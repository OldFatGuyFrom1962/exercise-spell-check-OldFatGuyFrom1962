U.S. Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co . new 
, seven-year funds -- one offering a fixed-rate return 
other with a floating-rate return linked * to 
London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to 
Japanese investors . First , designed *-1 to 
eliminate risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed securities can be 
retired *-43 early if rates decline , such 
prepayment forces investors to redeploy money at lower rates 
. Second , channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual

Pick a country , any country . It 's 
investment craze sweeping Wall Street : a rash of 
new closed-end country funds , those publicly traded portfolios that 
*T*-37 invest in stocks of a single foreign country . 
No fewer than 24 country funds *ICH*-1 have been launched 
*-2 or registered *-2 with regulators this year , triple 
of all of 1988 , to Charles 
E. Simon & Co. , a Washington-based research firm .

here *T*-1 . next province ? `` Anything 's 
-- how about New Guinea Fund ? '' 
quips *T*-1 George Foot , a managing partner at Newgate 
Associates of Northampton , Mass . recent explosion 
of country funds mirrors `` closed-end fund mania '' 
of 1920s , Mr. Foot says 0 *T*-2 , 
narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular *T*-1 . 
fell into oblivion after 1929 crash . Unlike traditional 
open-end mutual funds , most of one-country portfolios 
`` closed-end '' type , *-1 issuing a fixed 
number of shares that *T*-38 trade publicly . surge 
brings to nearly 50 number of country funds that 
*T*-39 *RNR*-1 or soon be *RNR*-1 listed *-2 
in New York or London . funds 
for several billions of dollars in assets . `` People 
looking *-1 to stake claims '' 
number of nations runs out , says *T*-2 
Michael Porter , an analyst at Smith Barney , Harris 
Upham & Co. , New York . Behind all 
hoopla is *T*-1 some heavy-duty competition . As individual investors 
have turned away from stock market over 
, securities firms have scrambled *-1 to find new products 
that brokers find *T*-40 easy 0 * to sell *T*-2 
. firms stretching nets far 
wide *-1 to do it . Financial planners urge 
investors *-1 to diversify to hold a smattering of 
international securities . emerging markets have outpaced more 
mature markets , such as U.S. Japan . 
Country funds offer an easy way 0 * to get 
a taste of foreign stocks without hard research of 
* seeking out individual companies *T*-1 . But it does 
n't take much * to get burned *-1 . Political 
currency gyrations can whipsaw funds . Another concern 
: funds ' share prices tend *-1 to swing 
more than broader market . stock market 
dropped nearly 7 % Oct. 13 *T*-1 , for instance 
, Mexico Fund plunged about 18 % 
Spain Fund fell 16 % . most country funds 
clobbered *-47 more than most stocks after 1987 
crash . What *ICH*-1 *T*-41 's so wild about 
funds ' frenzy right is that arte trading 
at historically fat premiums to value of underlying 
portfolios . After *-1 trading at an average discount of 
more than 20 % in late 1987 part of 
last year , country funds trade at an average 
premium of 6 % . reason : Share prices 
of of funds this year have climbed much 
more sharply than foreign stocks 0 hold *T*-1 
. It 's probably worth * paying a premium for 
funds that *T*-42 invest in markets that *T*-43 partially 
closed to foreign investors , such as South Korea , 
some specialists say 0 *T*-1 . But some European funds 
have skyrocketed ; Spain Fund has surged to a 
startling 120 % premium . It has been targeted *-48 
by Japanese investors as a good long-term play tied * 
to 1992 's European economic integration . several new 
funds that *T*-44 n't even fully invested yet have 
jumped *-1 to trade at big premiums . `` I 
'm very alarmed *-2 to see rich valuations , 
'' says *T*-1 Smith Barney 's Mr. Porter . 
newly fattened premiums reflect increasingly global marketing of some 
country funds , Mr. Porter suggests 0 *T*-1 . Unlike 
U.S. investors , those in Asia or Europe seeking 
foreign-stock exposure may be less resistant to * paying higher 
prices for country funds . `` may be an 
international viewpoint cast *-2 on funds listed * here 
, '' Mr. Porter says *T*-1 . Nonetheless , plenty 
of U.S. analysts money managers aghast at 
lofty trading of some country funds . argue 
that U.S. investors can buy American depositary receipts on 
big stocks in funds ; so-called ADRs 
represent shares of foreign companies traded * in U.S. 
. That way investors can essentially buy funds without 
*-1 paying premium . For people who *T*-45 insist 
on *-5 jumping in *-1 to buy funds 
, Newgate 's Mr. Foot says : `` only 
advice 0 I have *T*-2 for folks is that 
those who *T*-3 come to party late had better

, after two meetings with Soviets , a 
State Department spokesman said that it *EXP*-1 's `` too

Coincident with talks , State Department said 0 
it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New

Economic Affairs was approved *-1 last spring opened in

orders for manufactured goods spending on construction failed *-1 
to rise in September . Meanwhile , National Association 
of Purchasing said 0 its survey indicated that 
manufacturing economy contracted in October for sixth consecutive 
month . Its index inched up to 47.6 % in 
October from 46 % in September . Any reading below 
50 % suggests 0 manufacturing sector is generally declining 
. purchasing managers , , also said that 
orders turned up in October after four of decline 
. Factories booked $ 236.74 billion *U* in orders *ICH*-1 
in September , nearly same as $ 236.79 
billion *U* in August , Commerce Department said 0 
*T*-2 . If not for a 59.6 % surge in 
orders for capital goods by defense contractors , factory orders 
have fallen 2.1 % . In a report 
, department said 0 construction spending ran at an 
rate of $ 415.6 billion *U* , not significantly 
from $ 415.8 billion *U* reported * for 
August . Private construction spending was down , but 
activity was up . figures in both reports 
adjusted *-1 * to remove effects of usual 
seasonal , but n't adjusted for inflation . 
Kenneth Mayland , economist for Society Corp. , a Cleveland 
bank , said 0 demand for exports of factory goods 
is *-1 to taper off . At same 
time , drop in rates since spring 
has failed *-1 to revive residential construction industry . 
`` What sector is *T*-46 stepping forward *-2 to pick 
up slack ? '' he asked *T*-1 . `` 
I draw a blank . '' By most measures , 
nation 's industrial sector is growing very slowly

industrial-production index . Yet mony economists n't predicting that 
economy is about *-1 to slip into recession . 
cite a lack of `` imbalances '' that *T*-47 
early warning signals of a downturn . Inventories 
closely watched *-1 for such clues , for instance . 
Economists say 0 a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks 
in production that *T*-48 can lead to a recession . 
But yesterday 's factory orders report had good news on 
that front : it said 0 factory inventories fell 0.1 
% in September , first decline since 1987 
. `` This conforms to ` soft landing ' 
scenario , '' said *T*-1 Elliott Platt , an economist 
at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp . `` 
I do n't see any signs that inventories excessive 
. '' A soft landing is an economic slowdown that 
*T*-49 eases inflation without *-1 leading to a recession . 
department said 0 orders for nondurable goods -- those 
intended * to last fewer than three -- fell 
0.3 % in September to $ 109.73 billion *U* after 
*-1 climbing 0.9 % month . Orders for 
durable goods up 0.2 % to $ 127.03 billion

in September . Factory shipments fell 1.6 % to $ 
234.4 billion *U* after * rising 5.4 % in August

Commerce Department noted 0 *T*-1 . Manufacturers ' backlogs of 
unfilled orders rose 0.5 % in September to $ 497.34

defense capital goods sector . Excluding orders , backlogs 
declined 0.3 % . In its construction spending report , 
Commerce Department said 0 residential construction , which *T*-50 
for nearly half of all construction spending , was 
off 0.9 % *ICH*-3 in September to an rate 
of $ 191.9 billion *U* . David Berson , economist 
for Mortgage Bankers Association , predicted 0 drop 
in rates boost spending on single-family homes 
, but probably not until early next year . Spending 
on private , nonresidential construction was off 2.6 % to 
an rate of $ 99.1 billion *U* with no 
sector showing strength . construction spending rose 4.3 % 
to $ 88 billion *U* . After *-1 adjusting for 
inflation , Commerce Department said 0 construction spending did

construction spending figures contrast with a report issued * earlier

purchasing managers ' index continues *-1 to indicate

19 % of purchasing managers reported better export orders 
in October , down from 27 % in September . 
8 % *ICH*-1 said 0 export orders down 
last month , with 6 % month 
. purhasing managers ' report also added evidence that 
inflation is under control . For fifth consecutive month

Each of survey 's indicators gauges difference 
number of purchasers reporting improvement in a area

time , October survey polled members on imports . 
It found that of 73 % who *T*-51 import 
, 10 % *T*-1 said 0 imported more in 
October 12 % *T*-1 said 0 imported less 
than previous month . While *-1 acknowledging 0 one 
month 's figures do n't prove a trend , Mr. 
Bretz said , `` It does lead you to suspect 
0 imports going down , or at least not 
increasing that much . '' Items listed * as *-1 
being in short supply numbered only about a dozen , 
but included one newcomer : milk milk powder 
. `` It 's an odd thing 0 * to 
put *T*-1 on list , '' Mr. Bretz noted 
*T*-2 . He said that for second month in

. A disaffected , hard-drinking , nearly-30 hero sets off

has in tow his prescient girlfriend , whose sassy retorts

As an actor , Charles Lane is n't inheritor 
of Charlie Chaplin 's spirit . Steve Martin has already 
laid his claim to that . But it is Mr. 
Lane , as movie director , producer writer , 
who *T*-65 has been obsessed with * refitting Chaplin 's 
Little Tramp in a contemporary way . In 1976 , 
as a film student at Purchase campus of thi 
State of New York , Mr. Lane shot `` 
A Place in Time , '' a 36-minute black-and-white film 
about a sketch artist , a man of streets 
. , 13 , Mr. Lane has 
revived his Artist in a full-length movie called * `` 
Sidewalk Stories , '' a poignant piece of work about 
a modern-day tramp . Of course , if film 
contained dialogue , Mr. Lane 's Artist be called 
*-71 a homeless person . So *?* *T*-1 
Little Tramp , for that matter . I say `` 
* contained dialogue '' because `` Sidewalk Stories '' is 
n't silent at all . Composer Marc Marder , 
a college friend of Mr. Lane 's who *T*-66 earns 
his living *-1 playing double bass in classical music 
ensembles , has an exciting , eclectic score that 
*T*-67 tells you what characters thinking *T*-2 
*T*-2 far more precisely than intertitles , or even 
words , *?* . Much of Mr. Lane 's 
film takes a highly romanticized view of life on 
streets -LRB- though probably no more romanticized than Mr. Chaplin 
's notion of Tramp as good-hearted free spirit 
-RRB- . *-2 Filmed *-1 in lovely black white 
by Bill Dill , New York streets of `` 
Sidewalk Stories '' seem benign . On Wall Street men 
women walk with great purpose , *-2 noticing one 
another only thay jostle for cabs *T*-1 . 
Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village , on a strip 
of Sixth Avenue populated * by jugglers , magicians 
other good-natured hustlers . -LRB- This *ICH*-1 clearly is not 
real life : no crack dealers , no dead-eyed men 
selling four-year-old copies of Cosmopolitan , no one curled up 
in a cardboard box . -RRB- Artist has his 
. He spends his days *-1 sketching passers-by , 
or *-1 trying *-2 to *?* . At he 
returns to condemned 0 he calls *T*-1 home 
. His life , including his skirmishes with a competing 
sketch artist , seems carefree . He is his own 
man . Then , just as Tramp is given 
*-72 a blind girl 0 * to cure *T*-2 in 
`` City Lights , '' Artist is put *-73 
in charge of *-73 returning a two-year-old waif -LRB- Nicole 
Alysia -RRB- , whose father *T*-1 has been murdered *-74 
by thugs , to her mother . This cute child 
turns out *-1 to be a blessing a curse 
. She gives thi Artist a of purpose , 
but also alerts him to serious inadequacy of his 
vagrant life . beds at Bowery Mission seem 
far drearier he has *-1 to tuck a little 
girl into one of them at *T*-2 . *-1 
To load stakes , Mr. Lane dreamed up 
a highly improbable romance for Artist , with a 
young woman who *T*-68 owns her own children 's shop 
who *T*-69 lives in an expensive high-rise apartment 
. This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. 
Lane had as strong a presence in front of 
camera as he does *?* behind it . Mr. Lane 
's final purpose is n't *-1 to glamorize Artist 
's vagabond existence . He has a point 0 he 
wants *-1 to make *T*-2 , he makes it 
, with a great deal of force . movie 
ends with sound , sound of street people talking 
, is n't anything whimsical or enviable in 
those rough , beaten voices . French film maker 
Claude Chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with 
his `` Story of Women . '' He has made 
a harsh , brilliant picture -- one that *T*-70 's 
captivating -- about a character who , *-2 viewed *-3 
from most sympathetic angle , *T*-1 seem disagreeable 
. Yet this woman , Marie-Louise Giraud , carries historical 
significance , both as one of last women 0 
*T*-1 to be *-2 in France as a 
symbol of Vichy 's hypocrisy . While Vichy 
collaborated with Germans during World War II in 
deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters Jews , its 
officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor . Marie-Louise , a 
small-time abortionist , was woman . She became an 
abortionist accidentally , because it enabled her to 
buy jam , cocoa other war-rationed goodies . She 
was untrained , in one botched job killed a 
client . Her remorse was shallow . 
she was kind playful to her children , she 
was dreadful to her war-damaged husband ; she openly brought 
her lover into home . As * presented *-1 
by Mr. Chabrol , played *-1 with thin-lipped intensity 
by Isabelle Huppert , Marie-Louise -LRB- called * Marie Latour 
in film -RRB- was not a nice person . 
But she did n't deserve *-1 to have her head 
chopped *-2 off . is very little 0 *T*-1

of Carlos Fuentes novel of Mexican Revolution . 
Most of picture is taken up with endless scenes 
of mony people either fighting or eating drinking *-1

0 negative ad , for a secondary presence 
in most political campaigns , became main event *T*-1 
. irony is that attack , after 
*-1 getting a boost in last year 's presidential campaign 
, has come of age in an off-off election year 
with only a few contests scattered * across country 
. But in three leading political contests of 1989 
, negative ads have reached new of hostility 
, *-1 raising fears that this kind of mudslinging , 
empty of significant issues , is ushering in a new 
era of campaigns without content . `` , '' 
says *T*-1 Joseph Napolitan , a pioneer in political television 
, `` idea is * to attack first , 
last always . '' A trend that *T*-72 started 
with first stirrings of , accelerated with 
dawn of television age became a sometimes-tawdry art 
form in 1988 , has reached an entirely new stage 
. `` *-1 To get people 's attention days

, `` your TV ad needs *-1 to be bold

* Take a look , then , at main 
attack commercials that *T*-73 tone for Tuesday 's 
elections in New York City , New Jersey Virginia 
: New York City : screen fills with a 
small , tight facial shot of David Dinkins , Democratic 
candidate for mayor of New York City . `` David 
Dinkins failed *-2 to file his income taxes for four 
straight , '' says *T*-1 a disembodied male voice 
. then this television , paid for * 
by Republican Rudolph Giuliani 's campaign produced * by 
Roger Ailes , master of negative TV ads , 
gets down to business . Mr. Dinkins ,

his campaign contributions accurately , hid his links to a 
failing insurance company paid a convicted kidnapper `` 
a phony with no members , no receipts

issues director , `` designed * *-1 to prosecute a 
case of political corruption that *T*-74 simply does n't exist 
. '' *-2 Stung *-1 by Giuliani ads , 
Mr. Dinkins 's TV consultants , Robert Shrum David 
Doak , finally unleashed a negative ad of own 
. screen shows two distorted , unrecognizable photos , 
presumably of two politicians . `` * two candidates

, `` both candidates named *-2 Rudolph Giuliani

-- nobody . It 's a classic situation of 
ads that *T*-75 true but not always fully accurate 
. Mr. Dinkins did fail *-1 to file his income 
taxes for four , but he insists 0 he 
voluntarily admitted `` oversight '' he was being 
considered *-2 for a city job *T*-3 . He was 
on board of an insurance company with financial problems 
, but he insists 0 he made no secret of 
it . city 's Campaign Finance Board has refused 
*-1 to pay Mr. Dinkins $ 95,142 *U* in matching 
funds because his campaign records incomplete . campaign 
has blamed reporting problems on computer errors .

know 0 man 0 his campaign paid *T*-2 for 
a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted *-3 of kidnapping . 
But , say 0 *T*-1 Mr. Dinkins 's managers , 
he did have an office his did have

'' other side , he argues 0 *T*-1 , 
`` knows 0 Giuliani has always been pro-choice , even

'' Virginia : Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his 
gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion

of statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from screen 
, thi announcer continues : `` On issue of 
abortion , Marshall Coleman wants *-1 to take away your

Mr. Coleman *-1 to take away right of 
abortion `` even in cases of rape incest , 
'' a charge 0 Mr. Coleman denies *T*-2 -- changed 
dynamics of campaign , *-3 transforming it , 
at least in part , into a referendum on abortion 
. ad prompted Mr. Coleman , former Virginia 
attorney general , to launch a series of advertisements created 
* by Bob Goodman designed * *-2 to shake 
Mr. Wilder 's support among very women who *T*-77 
attracted *-1 by abortion ad . Coleman 
counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows 
ad that she was recalling an unpleasant 
courtroom ordeal . A voice says , `` C'mon ,

0 *T*-2 to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation . 
`` People have grown tired of ads Coleman

says 0 *T*-3 Robert Hormats , vice chairman of Goldman

*U* of Japanese investment *ICH*-1 in 1988 , 10 times

little tigers , '' also contributing to Southeast Asia 
's integration , but influence remain subordinate to 
Japan 's . For recipient countries such as Thailand 
Malaysia , investment provid needed jobs spur 
growth . But Asian nations ' harsh memories of 
military domination by Japan in early part of this 
century make them fearful of * falling under Japanese economic 
hegemony noe . Because of budget constraints in Washington , 
U.S. encourages Japan to share economic burdens in 
region . But it resists *-1 yielding political ground . 
In coming decade , analysts say 0 *T*-2 ,

`` U.S. , with its regional friends , must

outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries -LRB- 
U.S. remains leading trade partner for all 
of Asia -RRB- . Moreover , Japanese , 
world 's largest aid donor , is pumping 
far more assistance *ICH*-2 into region than U.S.

*-1 , Mrs. Yeargin admitted 0 she had given 
questions answers two days to two 
low-ability geography classes . She had gone so far as 
*-1 to display questions on an overhead projector 
underline answers . Mrs. Yeargin was fired *-1 
prosecuted *-1 under an unusual South Carolina law that *T*-79 
makes it *EXP*-2 a crime * to breach test 
. In September , she pleaded guilty paid a 
$ 500 *U* fine . Her alternative was 90 days 
in jail . Her story is partly one of personal 
downfall . She was an unstinting teacher who *T*-80 won 
laurels inspired , but she probably never 
teach . In her wake she left bitterness 
anger of a principal who *T*-81 was her friend 
calls her a betrayer ; of colleagues who 
*T*-82 say 0 she brought them shame ; of 
parents who *T*-83 defended her insist 0 she 
was treated *-1 harshly ; of school-district officials stunned 
that despite thi bald-faced of her actions , she 
became something of a local martyr . Mrs. Yeargin 's 
case also casts some light on dark side of 
school reform , where pressures on teachers growing *T*-1 
where high-stakes testing has enhanced temptation * to 
cheat *T*-2 . 1987 statute 0 Mrs. Yeargin violated 
*T*-1 was designed *-2 *-3 to enforce provisions of South

testing specialist at Boston College . `` So efforts 
* to beat tests also on hte rise 
. '' *-1 most disturbing , it is educators 
, not , who *T*-84 blamed *-2 for 
much of wrongdoing . A 50-state study released * 
in September by Friends for Education , an Albuquerque , 
N.M. , school-research group , concluded that `` outright cheating 
by American educators '' is `` common . '' 
group says 0 standardized achievement test scores greatly inflated 
because teachers `` teach test '' as Mrs. 
Yeargin did *?* , most never caught *-1 
. Evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states 
in last year or so . California 's education

By *-3 using them , teachers -- with administrative blessing 
-- telegraph to beforehand precise areas on which 
a test concentrate *T*-1 , sometimes give away 
a few exact questions answers . Use of Scoring 
High is widespread in South Carolina common in Greenville 
County , Mrs. Yeargin 's school district . Experts say 
0 is n't another state in country where 
tests as much as do *?* in South 
Carolina *T*-1 . Under state 's Education Improvement Act 
, low test scores can block ' promotions or 
force entire districts into wrenching , state-supervised `` interventions '' 
that *T*-86 can firings . High test scores , 
on other hand , bring recognition extra money 
-- a new computer lab for a school , grants 
for , a for superintendent . 
South Carolina says 0 it is getting results . 
Since reforms went in place , for example , 
no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on 
Scholastic Aptitude Test than South Carolina *?* , 
state still posts lowest average score of 
about 21 states who *T*-87 use SAT as 
primary college entrance . Critics say 0 South Carolina 
is paying a price by * stressing improved test scores 
so much . Friends of Education rates South Carolina one 
of worst seven states in its study on academic 
cheating . Says 0 *ICH*-3 's founder , 
John Cannell , * prosecuting Mrs. Yeargin is `` a 
way for 0 administrators to protect themselves *T*-4 look 
like take cheating seriously *T*-4 , in fact 
do n't take it seriously at all *T*-1 . 
'' Paul Sandifer , director of testing for South 
Carolina department of education , says 0 Mr. Cannell 's 
allegations of cheating `` purely without foundation , '' 
based on unfair inferences . Partly because of worries 
about potential abuse , , he says 0 
state begin *-1 keeping closer track of achievement-test preparation 
booklets next spring . South Carolina 's reforms designed 
*-1 for schools like Greenville High School . *-1 Standing 
on a shaded hill in a run-down area of this 
old textile city , school has educated of 
South Carolina 's best brightest , including state 
's last two governors , Nobel Prize winning physicist Charles 
Townes actress Joanne Woodward . But by early 
1980s , its glory *PPA*-1 had faded like yellow 
bricks of its broad facade . `` It was full 
of violence gangs kids cutting class , '' 
says *T*-1 Linda Ward , school 's principal . 
`` Crime was , test scores low , 
was no enrollment in honors programs . '' 
Mrs. Ward took over in 1986 , *-1 becoming 
school 's seventh principal in 15 . Her 
predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown . to his term 
, a teacher bled to death in halls , 
*-1 stabbed *-2 by a student . , Mrs. 
Ward says 0 *T*-1 , school was having trouble 
*-2 serving in harmony its two disparate , evenly 
split , student groups : a privileged white elite from 
old monied neighborhoods blacks , of them poor 
, from run-down , inner city neighborhoods . Mrs. Ward 
*-1 to clean out `` deadwood '' in 
school 's faculty restore safety , she also 
had some new factors working in her behalf . One 
was statewide school reform , which *T*-88 raised educational 
funding ushered in a new public spirit for school 
betterment . Another was Nancy Yeargin , who *T*-89 came 
to Greenville in 1985 , *-1 full of energy 
ambitions that reformers *-2 to reward *T*-3 . 
`` * Being a teacher just became my life , 
'' says *T*-1 37-year-old Mrs. Yeargin , a teacher 
for 12 her dismissal . `` I loved 
school , its history . I even dreamt about 
school new things 0 * to do *T*-1 with 
my . '' While Mrs. Ward fired restructured 
staff struggled *-1 to improve curriculum , Mrs. Yeargin 
worked 14-hour days anf fast became a student favorite . 
In 1986-87 1987-88 , she for *RNR*-1 
won *RNR*-1 pay under reform law . *-1 
Encouraged *-2 by Mrs. Ward , Mrs. Yeargin taught honor 
in state `` teacher cadet '' program , 
a reform creation designed * *-3 to good 
to teaching as a . She won grant 
money for school , advised cheerleaders , ran 
pep club , proposed taught a new `` Cultural 
Literacy '' class in Western Civilization was chosen *-1 
by school PTA as `` Teacher of Year 
. '' `` She was an inspirational lady ; she 
had it all , '' says *T*-1 Laura Dobson 
, a freshman at of South Carolina who 
*T*-90 had Mrs. Yeargin in teacher-cadet class last year 
. She says that because of Mrs. Yeargin she gave 
up ambitions in architecture is *-1 to become 
a teacher . Mary Beth Marchand , a Greenville 11th 
grader , also says 0 Mrs. Yeargin inspired her to 
go into education . `` She taught us more in 
Western Civilization than I 've ever learned in other classes 
, '' says *T*-2 Kelli Green , a Greenville 
. In classroom , say 0 *T*-3 , 
Mrs. Yeargin distinguished herself by * varying teaching approaches -- 
*-1 forcing kids to pair up *-2 to complete classroom 
work or using college-bowl type competitions . On weekends , 
she came to work *-1 to prepare study plans or 
sometimes , even *-1 to polish furniture in her 
classroom . `` She just never gave it up , 
'' says *T*-1 Mary Marchand , Mary Beth 's mother 
. `` You 'd see her correcting homework in 
stands at a football game . '' Some fellow teachers 
, , viewed Mrs. Yeargin as cocky too 
yielding to . Mrs. Ward says 0 she 
defended her to colleagues who *T*-91 called her a grandstander 
. Pressures began *-1 to . Friends told her 
0 she was pushing too hard . Because of deteriorating 
hearing , she told colleagues 0 she feared 0 she 
might not be able *-1 to teach much longer . 
Mrs. Yeargin 's extra work was also helping her earn 
points in state 's incentive-bonus program . But 
most important of points was student improvement on tests 
. Huge gains by her in 1987 1988 
a total of $ 5,000 *U* in bonuses over 
two -- a meaningful addition to her salary 
of $ 23,000 *U* . * Winning a for 
a third year was n't that important to her , 
Mrs. Yeargin insists 0 *T*-1 . But others at Greenville 
High say 0 she was eager *-1 to win -- 
if not for money , then for pride recognition 
. Mary Elizabeth Ariail , another social-studies teacher , says 
0 she believed 0 Mrs. Yeargin *-1 to keep 
her standing high so she could get a new job 
that *T*-92 n't demand good hearing . , 
Mrs. Yeargin was interested in a job with 
state teacher cadet program . Last March , after *-1 
attending a teaching seminar in Washington , Mrs. Yeargin says 
0 she returned to Greenville two days testing 
*-2 that she had n't her low-ability geography 
. test booklets passed *-1 out 
48 hours ahead of time *T*-2 , she says 0 
she copied questions in social studies section gave 
answers to . Mrs. Yeargin admits 0 she 
made a big mistake but insists 0 her motives 
correct . `` I was trying *-1 to help kids 
in an unfair testing situation , '' she says *T*-2 
. `` Only five of 40 questions geography 
questions . rest history , sociology , finance 
-- subjects 0 never had *T*-1 . '' Mrs. 
Yeargin says that she also *-1 to help *-2 
lift Greenville High School 's test scores , usually 
near bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings 
carried * annually by local newspapers . Mostly , she 
says 0 *T*-1 , she *-2 to prevent 
damage to self-esteem that her low-ability suffer *T*-3 
from * doing badly on test . `` 
kids broke my heart , '' she says *T*-1 . 
`` A whole day goes by no one even 
knows 0 're alive . needed somebody 
who *T*-93 showed 0 cared for them , who 
*T*-94 loved them . last thing 0 thay needed 
*T*-1 was another drag-down blow . '' School officials 
prosecutors say 0 Mrs. Yeargin is lying . found 
in an advanced class a year earlier who *T*-95 
said 0 she gave them similar help , because 
case was n't tried in court , this evidence 
was never presented *-1 publicly . `` That pretty much 
defeats any inkling that she was out *-1 to help 
poor underprivileged child , '' says Joe Watson , 
prosecutor in case , who *T*-96 is also 
president of Greenville High School 's alumni association . Mrs. 
Yeargin concedes that she went over questions in 
earlier class , *-1 adding : `` I *-2 
to help all '' . Mr. Watson says 0 
Mrs. Yeargin never complained to school officials that standardized 
test was unfair . `` Do I have much sympathy 
for her ? '' Mr. Watson asks *T*-1 . `` 
Not . I in . I 
0 you have *-1 to use *-2 
to change it . What she did *T*-97 was like 
* taking law into your own hands . '' 
Mrs. Ward says that cheating was discovered *-4 
*T*-1 , she *-2 to avoid thi morale-damaging public 
disclosure that a trial bring *T*-3 . She says 
0 she offered Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation thought 
0 she could help *-1 save her teaching certificate . 
Mrs. Yeargin declined . `` She said something like ` 
You just want *-1 to make it easy for 
school . ' I was dumbfounded , '' Mrs. Ward 
recalls *T*-1 . `` It was like had turned 
a knife in me . '' To astonishment 
dismay of her superiors legal authorities -- 
as a measure of unpopularity of standardized tests -- 
Mrs . Yeargin won widespread local support . school-board 
hearing at which she was dismissed *-2 *T*-1 was crowded 
*-4 with , teachers parents who *T*-98 came 
*-3 to testify on her behalf . Supportive callers decried 
unfair testing , not Mrs. Yeargin , on a local 
radio talk show on which she appeared *T*-1 . 
show did n't give particulars of Mrs. Yeargin 's 
offense , *-1 saying only that she helped do 
better on test . `` message to 
board of education out of all this is 0 we 
've got *-1 to take a serious look at how 
we 're doing our curriculum our testing policies *T*-2 
in this state , '' said *T*-3 talk-show host 
. Editorials in Greenville newspaper allowed that Mrs. Yeargin 
was wrong , but also said 0 case showed 
how testing was being overused *-2 *T*-1 . radio 
show `` enraged us , '' says *T*-1 Mrs. Ward 
. Partly because of show , Mr. Watson says 
0 *T*-1 , district not *-2 to 
Mrs. Yeargin for a first-time offenders program that *T*-99 could 
have expunged charges conviction from her record 
. legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of

, interviewed *-1 . At Greenville High School , 
meanwhile , some -- on cheerleading squad 
-- crushed *-1 . `` It *EXP*-1 's hard 
* to explain to a 17-year-old why 0

Mrs. Ward . Soon , T-shirts *ICH*-1 appeared in 
corridors that *T*-2 carried school 's red-and-white GHS

'' colleagues angry at Mrs. Yeargin . `` 
She did a lot of harm , '' says *T*-1 
Cathryn Rice , who *T*-100 had discovered hte crib notes 
. `` We work damn hard at what we do 
*T*-101 for damn little pay , what she did 
*T*-1 cast unfair aspersions on all of us . '' 
But several teachers also say 0 incident casts 
on wisdom of * evaluating teachers or schools by 
* using standardized test scores . Says *ICH*-1 Gayle Key 
, a mathematics teacher , `` incentive pay thing 
has opened up a can of worms . may 
be others doing what she did *T*-1 . '' Mrs. 
Yeargin says 0 she pleaded guilty because she realized 0 
it *EXP*-2 no longer be *-1 to win

. Mrs. Ward , for one , was relieved . 
Despite strong evidence against Mrs. Yeargin , popular sentiment 
*ICH*-1 was so strong *ICH*-3 in her favor , Mrs.

, schoolteacher , William Mehrens , a Michigan 
State education professor , concluded in a study last 
June that CAT test versions of Scoring High Learning 
Materials should n't be used *-2 in classroom because 
of similarity to actual test . devised 
a 69-point scale -- *-1 awarding one point for each 
subskill measured * on CAT test -- *-1 to 
rate closeness of test preparatives to fifth-grade CAT 
. Because of subskills -- symmetry of 
geometrical figures , metric measurement of volume , or pie 
bar graphs , for example -- only a 
small part of total fifth-grade curriculum , Mr. Kaminski 
says 0 *T*-1 , preparation kits n't replicate 
too , if real intent was general instruction 
or even general familiarization with test procedures . But Learning 
Materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills . Scoring High 
matched on 64.5 . In CAT sections where ' 
knowledge of two-letter consonant sounds is tested *-1 *T*-2 , 
authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on same 
sounds that test does *?* *T*-4 -- to 
exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know *T*-3

dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test 
items . Rick Brownell , editor of Scoring High 
, says that Messrs. Kaminski Mehrens ignoring `` 
need 0 have *T*-1 for * becoming

authors of Scoring High `` scrupulously avoid '' *-1 replicating 
exact questions , but he does n't deny that some 
items similar . Scoring High first came out 
in 1979 *T*-1 , it was a publication of Random 
House . McGraw-Hill was outraged . In a 1985 advisory

1988 , McGraw-Hill purchased Random House unit that *T*-108

Department of Health Human Services plans *-1 to 
extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue 
transplants . Medical researchers 0 transplantation of small 
amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help * treat 
juvenile diabetes such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer 's , 
Parkinson 's Huntington 's . But anti-abortionists oppose such 
research because worry that development of therapies using 
fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions . 
James Mason , assistant secretary for health , said 0 
ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research `` 
should be *-1 indefinitely . '' He said 0 
ban wo n't stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or 
federally funded fetal-tissue research that *T*-111 does n't involve transplants 
. Department officials say that HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan 
support Dr. Mason 's ruling , which *T*-112 be

research , asked for an HHS review of its plan 
* to implant fetal tissue into brain of a 
patient from Parkinson 's disease *T*-1 . department 
placed a moratorium on research , * pending a 
review of scientific , legal ethical issues . A 
of an NIH-appointed panel recommended late last year that 
research continue under carefully conditions , but 
issue became embroiled *-2 in as anti-abortion groups 
*-3 to oppose federal funding . dispute has hampered 
administration 's efforts * to recruit prominent doctors 0 
*T*-1 to fill prestigious posts at helm of 
NIH Centers for Disease Control . Several candidates 
have withdrawn names from consideration after administration officials asked 
them for views on abortion fetal-tissue transplants . 
Antonio Novello , whom Mr. Bush nominated *T*-113 to serve 
as surgeon general , reportedly has assured administration that 
she opposes abortion . Dr. Novello is deputy director of 
National Institute of Child Health Human Development . 
Some researchers have charged that administration is imposing new 
ideological tests for top scientific posts . Earlier this week 
, Dr. Sullivan tried *-1 to defuse charges by 
*-4 stressing that candidates 0 *T*-2 to head NIH 
CDC be judged *-3 by `` standards 
of scientific administrative excellence , '' not . 
But administration 's handling of fetal-tissue transplant issue 
disturbs scientists . `` scientific progress moves into 
uncharted ground *T*-1 , has *-3 to be a 
role *ICH*-4 for society * to make judgments about its 
applications , '' says *T*-2 Myron Genel , associate dean 
of Yale Medical School . `` disturbing thing 
about this abortion issue is that debate has become 
polarized *-1 , so that no mechanism *ICH*-2 exists '' 
for * finding a middle ground . Yale is one 
of hte few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on 
fetal-tissue transplants . But Dr. Genel warns that Dr. Mason 
's ruling may discourage private funding . `` unavailability 
of federal funds , climate in which 
was made *-2 *T*-1 , certainly do n't 
any incentive for one of more visible foundations to 
support , '' he said *T*-3 . Despite 
flap over transplants , federal funding of research involving fetal 
tissues continue on a number of fronts . `` 
Such research may ultimately result in * to 
regenerate damaged tissues or * to turn off genes that 
*T*-114 cause cancer '' or * to regulate genes that 
*T*-115 cause Down 's syndrome , leading cause of 
mental retardation , to an NIH summary .

it almost seems that 's a race *ICH*-2

Wine auctions have almost exhausted limited supply of those

, wine director at Schaefer 's in Skokie , Ill. 
, one of top stores in suburban Chicago , 
`` but people out thear with very 
opinions of value . We got our two six-packs -- 
're gone . '' Mr. Pratt remarked that 
he thinks 0 steeper prices have come about because producers 
do n't like *-1 to see a hit wine dramatically 
increase in price on . Even if is 
consumer resistance at first , a wine that *T*-167 wins 
high ratings from critics move . `` 
may be sticker-shock reaction initially , '' said *T*-2 
Mr. Pratt , `` but as wine is talked 
about *-1 starts *-1 to sell , 
get excited 0 it 's worth astronomical 
price *-3 to add it to collection . '' 
`` It 's just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with 
some people , '' added *T*-1 Larry Shapiro . ``

*-2 even lowering price from $ 115 *U* to 
$ 90 *U* . It 's hardly a question of 
quality -- 1982 Salon is a beautiful wine , 
but , as Mr. Pratt noted 0 *T*-1 , people 
have own ideas about value . It *EXP*-1 's

's skittishness about Japanese investment could color a second round 
of bilateral economic talks scheduled * for next week in 
Washington . Not that Washington Tokyo disagree on 
Japanese acquisitions ; , each has come out in 
favor of unfettered investment in U.S. . Where 
disagree *T*-1 is on subject of U.S. direct investment 
in Japan . U.S. wants removal of what 
it perceives *T*-183 as barriers to investment ; Japan denies 
0 real barriers . heated talk stirred 
*-1 up by recent Japanese investments in U.S. is 
focusing attention on differences in investment climate , even 
though it 's only one of subjects 0 *T*-2 
to be covered *-116 in bilateral talks , known 
* as Structural Impediments Initiative . Japanese `` 
should see this rhetoric as a signal of need 
for a change in own economy , '' says 
0 *T*-1 Charles Dallara , U.S. assistant Treasury secretary , 
who *T*-184 has been in Tokyo this week *-2 informally 
discussing thi impending negotiations with goverment business leaders . 
`` We have a long history of * maintaining an 
open direct-investment policy , '' Mr. Dallara says *T*-1 . 
`` U.S. investors should have a greater at direct 
investment '' in Japan . Japanese fret openly about 
U.S. public 's rancor . One clear sign of 
Japan 's nervousness came this week , a spokesman 
for Japan 's Foreign Ministry devoted nearly all of a 
regular , half-hour briefing for foreign journalists to subject 
of recent Japanese investments in U.S. *T*-1 . `` 
We belive that it *EXP*-3 is vitally important for those 
Japanese business interests -LCB- in U.S. . -RCB- to 
be more aware of emotions concerns of 
American people , '' said *T*-1 spokesman , Taizo 
Watanabe . At same time , though , he 
chastised media for * paying such close attention to 
Japanese investment other foreign countries , notably Britain , 
acquiring more American assets *T*-1 . Fears that Japanese 
investors buying up America have escalated sharply in 
past several weeks , with Sony Corp. 's purchase of 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. from Coca-Cola Co. Mitsubishi Estate 
Co. 's acquisition of a 51 % holding in Rockefeller 
Group , owner of some of midtown Manhattan 's 
most exclusive real estate . Even those moves added 
fuel , fires of discontent had been well stoked 
*-1 by highly publicized in Japan of one 
U.S. investor , T. Boone Pickens Jr . Texas 
oilman has acquired a 26.2 % stake valued * at 
more than $ 1.2 billion *U* in an automotive-lighting company 
, Koito Manufacturing Co . But he has failed *-1 
to gain any influence at company . Koito has 
refused *-1 to grant Mr. Pickens seats on its board 
, *-1 asserting 0 he is a greenmailer trying * 
to pressure Koito 's other shareholders into * buying him 
out at a . Mr. Pickens made conciderable political 
hay with his troubles in Japan . Senate Finance

Sen. Lloyd Bentsen , last month urged U.S. Trade 
Carla Hills to use Mr. Pickens 's in talks 
with Tokyo `` *-1 to highlight this facing Americans 
who *T*-185 seek to Japanese capital markets . 
'' While Mr. Dallara Japanese officials say 0 
question of investors ' acess to U.S. Japanese 
markets may get a disproportionate share of public 's 
attention , a number of other important economic issues wil 
be on at next week 's talks . 
Among them *T*-1 differences in savings investment rates 
, structures , spending . 
Each side has a litany of recommendations for other 
. U.S. says 0 it is anxious for results 
. `` We feel very strongly that we need 
action across full range of issues 0 we 've 
identified *T*-1 , we need it by next spring 
, '' Mr. Dallara says *T*-2 . Both sides have 
agreed that talks be most if negotiators 
start by * focusing on areas that *T*-186 can 
be most changed *-1 . But have n't 
clarified what those might be *T*-187 . After first 
of meetings two ago , some U.S. officials 
complained that Japan had n't come up with specific changes 
0 it was *-1 to make *T*-2 . 
Japanese retort that first round was too early * 
to make concessions . `` * Just to say 0 
distribution is wrong does n't anything , 
'' says *T*-1 a Ministry of International Trade anf Industry 
official . `` We need *-1 to clarify what 
*T*-188 is wrong with it . '' That process of 
* sorting out specifics is likely *-1 to take time 
, Japanese say 0 *T*-2 , no matter how 
badly U.S. wants quick results *T*-3 . For instance 
, at first meeting two sides could n't 
even agree on basic used * in price discussions

Japanese investments in U.S. , Japan 's big trading 
companies arte rapidly increasing stake in America 's smaller 
business . For Japan , controversial trend improves 
to American markets technology . But for small American 
companies , it also provides a growing of capital 
even marketing help . * Take deal with 
Candela Laser Corp. , a Wayland , Mass. , manufacturer 
of high-tech medical devices , which three ago *T*-1 
its sights on Japan as an export market . 
Partly *-1 to help *-2 clear myriad obstacles facing 
any overseas company trying * to penetrate Japan , tiny 
Candela turned to Mitsui & Co. , one of Japan 
's largest trading companies , for investment . In a 
joint-venture deal , Mitsui guided Candela Tokyo 's bureaucratic 
maze . It secured Ministry of Health import approval 
for two Candela laser products -- one that *T*-189 breaks 
up kidney stones another that *T*-190 treats skin lesions 
. At last count , Candela had sold $ 4 
million *U* of its medical devices in Japan . 
deal also gave Mitsui to a high-tech medical product 
. `` view this as a growth area so 
went about it with a systematic , '' 
says *T*-1 Richard Olsen , a Candela vice president . 
, for Japanese trading companies , favorite 
U.S. small business is one whose research development *T*-1 
can be milked *-117 for future Japanese use . 
Japanese companies bankroll small U.S. companies with promising products 
or ideas , *-1 frequently putting money behind 
that banks wo n't touch *T*-191 . Japanese companies 
have financed small medium-sized U.S. firms for , 
but in recent , pace has taken off 
. In first half of 1989 alone , Japanese 
corporations invested $ 214 million *U* *ICH*-2 in minority positions

figure for all of 1987 , reports 0 *T*-1 Venture 
Economics Inc . Needham , Mass. , concern tracks 
investments in new businesses . In addition , of course 
, some of Japanese investments involved outright purchase of 
small U.S. firms . Heightened Japanese in American small 
business parallels an acceleration of investments giving Japanese companies control 
of large , highly visible U.S. corporations , such as 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc . Only this week , it 
*EXP*-1 was announced *-118 that Mitsubishi Estate Co. had acquired 
a 51 % stake in Rockefeller Group , which *T*-192 
owns New York 's prestigious Rockefeller Center . While 
small deals far less conspicuous , add to 
Japanese penetration of U.S. market . As deals 
also improve Japanese to American technology market knowledge 
, feed American anxieties in this area , too 
. Even a low-tech product like plate glass can catch 
a trading company 's fancy if 's a strategic 
fit . Free State Glass Industries of Warrenton , Va. 
, a small fabricator of architectural glass , was foundering 
under its original . Last year , Mitsubishi International 
Corp. , New York-based arm of Mitsubishi Corp. , 
bought controlling in glass company in a joint 
venture with Ronald Bodner , a glass industry executive 
Mitsubishi consultant . deal is chiefly designed *-1 *-3 
to give Mitsubishi a window on U.S. glass industry 
, says *T*-2 Ichiro Wakui , an executive in Mitsubishi 
's general merchandise department in New York . `` It 
's not just a simple investment in a small company 
, '' Mr. Wakui says *T*-1 . `` We want

not thi outside . '' Mitsubishi 's investment in Free 
State is `` very small ... less than $ 4

banks *-1 promoting packages . One big 
reason : thin margins . banks , smaller 
ones , slow *-1 to computerize could n't 
target market niches that *T*-199 have made programs 
more profitable . As banks ' earnings squeezed *-122

computers enabling more banks to analyze customers by 
age , income geography . better able 
*-1 to get to those segments in wake of 
deregulation that *T*-200 began in late 1970s . 
Deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can 
pay *T*-201 for deposits , as well as opened up 
field for new products such as high-rate CDs . 
Where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings 
*T*-2 , it began *-1 offering money-market , certificates 
of deposit interest-bearing checking , staggering rates based 
on size of deposits . competition has grown 
more intense as bigger banks such as Norwest Corp. of 
Minneapolis Chemical Banking Corp. of New York extend 
market-share battles into small towns across nation . `` 
Today , a banker is worrying about local , regional 
money-center -LCB- banks -RCB- , as well as thrifts 
unions , '' says *T*-1 Ms. Moore at 
Synergistics Research . `` So people who *T*-202 n't

`` This much fragmentation makes * attracting keeping today

Sullivan says 0 *T*-2 , more likely 
*-3 to be attracted *-123 to a package -- 
*-3 to be loyal to bank that *T*-205 offers 
it . That can pay off down road as 
customers , younger ones , change from borrowers 
to savers\/investors . Packaging has some drawbacks . additional 
technology , training promotional effort can be expensive 
. Chemical Bank spent more than $ 50 million *U* 
*-1 to introduce its ChemPlus line , several packages aimed 
* at segments , in 1986 , to 
Thomas Jacob , vice president of marketing . `` 
It *EXP*-1 's not easy * to roll out something

Jacob says *T*-2 . Still , bankers expect packaging to 
flourish , because more customers demanding that financial 
services be tailored *-124 to needs . ``

Ms. Moore says *T*-2 . Some banks already 
in that direction , to Alvin T. Sale ,

. art of change-ringing is peculiar to English 
, , like most English peculiarities , unintelligible to 
rest of world . -- Dorothy L. Sayers 
, `` Nine Tailors '' ASLACTON , England -- 
Of all scenes that *T*-219 evoke rural England , this 
is one of loveliest *T*-2 : An ancient stone 
church stands amid fields , sound of bells 
cascading from its tower , *-1 calling faithful to 
evensong . parishioners of St. Michael All Angels 
stop *-1 to chat at church door , as 
members here always have *?* . In tower , 
five men women pull rhythmically on ropes attached * 
to same five bells that *T*-220 first sounded here 
in 1614 . But is also a discordant , 
modern note in Aslacton , though it ca n't be 
heard *-135 by thw church-goers enjoying peal of bells 
this cool autumn evening . Like most of other 
6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells , St. 
Michael once had its own `` band '' of ringers 
, who *T*-221 herald every Sunday morning evening 
service . noe , only one local ringer *ICH*-1 remains 
: 64-year-old Derek Hammond . others here today live 
elsewhere . belong to a group of 15 ringers 
-- including two octogenarians four youngsters in training -- 
who *T*-222 drive every Sunday from church to church in 
a sometimes-exhausting effort * to keep bells sounding in 
belfries of East Anglia . `` *-1 To 
ring for even one service at this tower , we 
have *-1 to scrape , '' says *T*-2 Mr. Hammond 
, a retired water-authority worker . `` We 've tried 
*-1 to train youngsters , but have 
discos dances , just drift away 
. '' Mr. Hammond worries that old age 
flightiness of youth diminish ranks of East 
Anglian group that *T*-223 keeps Aslacton bells pealing . 
History , after all , is not on his side 
. to a nationwide survey taken * a year 
ago , nearly a third of England 's church bells 
no longer rung *-1 on Sundays because is 
no one 0 *T*-2 to ring them . It *EXP*-1 
is easy * to see why ancient art is 
on ropes *T*-2 . less complicated version of 
* playing tunes on bells , as do *?* 
carillons of continental Europe , is considered by English 
*-136 to be childish , fit only for foreigners . 
Change-ringing , a mind-boggling exercise 0 English invented *T*-1 
380 ago , requires physical dexterity -- some bells 
weigh more than a ton -- combined * with intense 
mental concentration . Proper English bells started *-1 off 
in `` rounds , '' from highest-pitched bell to 
lowest -- a simple descending scale using , in 
larger churches , as as 12 bells . Then 
, at a signal , ringers begin *-1 varying 
order in which bells sound *T*-2 without * 
altering steady rhythm of striking . Each variation 
, or change , can occur only once , 
rules state 0 *T*-1 . Ringers memorize of changes 
, known * as `` methods , '' which *T*-224 
have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire 
Caters . A series of 5,000 or so changes is 
a `` peal '' takes about three hours . 
A look at a Thursday practice at St. Mary 
Abbot church in thi Kensington district of London gives an 
idea of work involved * . Ten shirt-sleeved ringers 
stand in a circle , one foot ahead of 
other in a prize-fighter 's stance , each pulling a 
rope that *T*-225 disappears a small hole in 
high ceiling of ringing chamber . No one speaks 
, snaking of ropes seems *-1 to 
make as much sound as bells themselves *?* , 
*-2 muffled *-3 by ceiling . *-1 absorbed 
, ringers stare straight ahead , *-1 using peripheral 
vision -LRB- call it `` rope-sight '' -RRB- *-2 
to watch other ropes thus time pulls 
. Far above in belfry , huge bronze 
bells , mounted * on wheels , swing madly 
a full 360 degrees , *-1 starting ending , 
surprisingly , in inverted , or mouth-up . 
Skilled ringers use wrists *-1 to advance or retard 
next swing , so that one bell can swap 
places with another in following change . In a 
well-known detective-story involving church bells , English novelist Dorothy L. 
Sayers ringing as a `` passion -LCB- that -RCB- 
*T*-1 finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness mechanical perfection 
. '' Ringers , she added 0 *T*-2 , 
`` filled *-1 with solemn intoxication that *T*-226 comes 
of intricate ritual faultlessly performed * . '' `` Ringing 
does become a bit of an obsession , '' admits 
*T*-1 Stephanie Pattenden , master of band at St. 
Mary Abbot one of England 's best female ringers 
. It is a passion that *T*-227 usually stays in 
tower , . More than not , 
ringers think of church as something stuck * on 
bottom of belfry . changes 
completed *-137 *T*-1 , after have worked up 
a sweat , ringers skip off to local 
pub , *-2 leaving worship for others below . This 
does not sit well with some clerics . With membership 
of Church of England steadily dwindling , strong-willed vicars 
pressing equally strong-willed non-religious ringers to attend 
services . Two ago , Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone 
, vicar of Great Torrington , Devon , got so 
fed up with ringers who *T*-228 did n't attend service 
0 he sacked entire band ; ringers promptly 
up a picket line in protest . `` 
a self-perpetuating club that *T*-229 treated tower as 
sort of a premises , '' Vicar Hummerstone 
says *T*-1 . An entirely new band *ICH*-2 rings today 
at Great Torrington , several of whom *T*-1 members 
of congregation . But still n't enough 
ringers 0 *T*-1 to ring more than six of 
eight bells . At St. Mary 's Church in Ilminster 
, Somerset , bells have fallen *-1 silent following 
a dust-up over church attendance . vicar , W.D. 
Jones , refuses *-1 to talk about it , *-1 
saying 0 it `` reopen wound . '' 
But C.J.B. Marshall , vicar of a nearby church , 
feels 0 fault is in stairs from 
bell tower that *T*-1 located *-138 next to 
altar . `` So crunch , crunch , crunch , 
bang , bang , bang -- here come *T*-4 
ringers from above , *-1 making a very obvious exit 
while congregation is at prayer , '' he says 
*T*-2 . Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this 
issue , since he is both a vicar an 
active bell-ringer himself . `` sound of bells is 
a net 0 *T*-1 to draw people into church 
, '' he says *T*-2 . `` I live in 
hopes that ringers themselves be drawn *-139 into 
that fuller life . '' Central Council of Church 
Bell Ringers , a sort of parliament of ringing groups 
, aims *-1 to improve relations with vicars , says 
0 *T*-2 John C. Baldwin , president . It hopes 
*-1 to speak to at theological colleges about 
joys of bell ringing shortly publish a booklet 
for every vicar in country entitled , `` 
Bells in Your Care . '' Says *ICH*-1 Mr. Baldwin 
, `` We recognize that we may no longer have 
as high a priority in church life . 
'' Mr. Baldwin is also attacking greater : 
lack of ringers . One survey says that of 
100,000 trained bellringers in England today , only 40,000 of 
them still ring . Also , ringers do n't always 
live where bells need *-1 to be rung *-140 
*T*-2 -- like in small , rural parishes inner-city 
churches . But council 's program * to attract 
train ringers is only partly , says 0 
*T*-1 Mr. Baldwin . `` Right , we 're 
lucky if after five we keep one new ringer 
out of 10 , '' he adds *T*-1 . One 
bright sign is that a growing number of women have 
entered once male-dominated field ; more than a third 
of ringers today women . n't 
*-1 everywhere , . oldest bell-ringing group 
in country , Ancient Society of College Youths 
, founded * in 1637 , remains male-only , a 
fact that *T*-230 's galling to women because 
group is sole of ringers for Britain 's 
most prestigious churches , St. Paul 's Cathedral Westminster 
Abbey . This being Britain , no woman has filed 
an equal-opportunity suit , but extent of 
surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` 
Ringing World , '' a weekly newspaper for ringers 
. One writer , signing his letter as `` Red-blooded 
, balanced male , '' remarked on `` frequency 
of women fainting in peals , '' that 
`` settle back into traditional role of * 
making tea at meetings . '' In torrent of 
replies that *T*-1 followed , one woman ringer from Solihull 
observed that `` average male ringer leaves quite a 
lot 0 *T*-2 to be desired *-141 : *-3 badly 
dressed , decorated with acne a large beer-belly , 
frequently unwashed unbearably flatulent in peals . '' Another 
women from Sheffield *-1 to say that in her 
60 of ringing , `` I have never known 
a lady to faint in belfry . I have 
one or two men die , * bless them 
. Investors unsettled * by stock market 's gyrations 
can take some comfort in predictable arrival of quarterly 
dividend checks . That has been true this year 
with companies raising payouts more than 10 % 
. But * do n't breathe too easy : Those 
dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices , 
some analysts warn 0 *T*-1 . In past , 
thay say 0 *T*-1 , strongest dividend growth has 
come at times stock-market party was almost 
over *T*-2 . That can be a trap for unwary 
investors , says 0 *T*-1 Richard Bernstein , quantitative 
analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co . Strong dividend growth 
, he says 0 *T*-1 , is `` black 
widow of valuation '' -- a to female 
spiders that *T*-231 attract males then kill them after 
mating . Stephen Boesel , president of T. Rowe Price 
Growth Income Fund , explains that companies raise 
payouts most robustly only after economy 
have been growing for some time . `` Invariably , 
those strong periods in economy give way to recessionary 
environments , '' he says *T*-1 . `` recessionary 
environments n't hospitable to stock market . '' 
, analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most 
sharply prices already on way down from 
cyclical peaks *T*-1 . In 1976 , for example , 
dividends on stocks in Standard & Poor 's 500-stock 
index soared 10 % , following much slower growth 
year . S&P index started *-1 sliding in 
price in September 1976 , fell 12 % in 
1977 -- despite a 15 % in dividends that 
year . That pattern has n't always held , but 
recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious 
. Payouts on S&P 500 stocks rose 10 % 
in 1988 , to Standard & Poor 's Corp. 
, Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth generally 
9 % 14 % *U* . people 
0 growth in dividends slow next year 
, a minority see double-digit gains continuing . Meanwhile 
, market watchers say 0 recent dividend trends raise 
another warning flag : While dividends have risen smartly , 
has n't kept pace with even stronger advances 
in stock prices . As a result , market 
's dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of price 
-- has slid to a that *T*-232 is fairly 
low unenticing by historical standards . * Put *-1 
another way , decline in yield suggests 0 
stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to 
dividends 0 pay *T*-2 , some market analysts say 
0 *T*-3 . keeping a close watch on 
yield on S&P 500 . figure is 
about 3.3 % , up from 3.2 % 
recent market slide . Some analysts say 0 investors 
should run for exits if a sustained market rebound 
pushes yield below 3 % . A drop below 
that 3 % benchmark `` has always been a strong 
warning sign that stocks fully valued *-2 , '' 
says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price . 
In fact , `` market has always tanked . 
Always . 's never been an exception , '' 
says 0 *T*-1 Gerald W. Perritt , a Chicago investment 
adviser money manager , based on a review of 
six decades of stock-market . last time 0 
S&P 500 yield dropped below 3 % *T*-1 was 
in summer of 1987 . Stockholders who *T*-233 took 
hint sold shares escaped October debacle . 
have been only seven other times -- in 1929 
, 1933 , 1961 , 1965 , 1968 , 1971 
1972 -- yield on S&P 500 
dropped below 3 % for at least two consecutive 
*T*-1 , Mr. Perritt found 0 *T*-2 . in 
each case , he says 0 *T*-1 , a sharp 
drop in stock prices began a year . Still 
, some market analysts say 0 current 3.3 % 
reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been 
*?* in past . `` It 's not a 
very meaningful indicator because corporations not behaving in 
a traditional manner , '' says *T*-1 James H. Coxon 
, head of stock investments for Cigna Corp. , 
Philadelphia-based insurer . In , Mr. Coxon says 0 
*T*-1 , businesses paying out a smaller percentage of 
cash flow *ICH*-3 in form of 
dividends than have *?* historically . So , while 
stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends , 
not excessive relative to underlying strength 
. Rather than *-1 increasing dividends , some companies have 
used cash *-1 to buy back some of shares 
, notes 0 *T*-2 Steven G. Einhorn , co-chairman of 
investment policy at Goldman , Sachs & Co 
. He factors that into market yield *-1 to 
get an adjusted yield of about 3.6 % . That 
is just a tad below average of past 
40 or so , he says 0 *T*-1 . 
What *T*-234 happen to dividend growth next year ? 
Common wisdom suggests a single-digit rate of growth , reflecting 
a weakening in economy . PaineWebber 
Inc. , for instance , is forecasting growth in S&P 
500 dividends of just under 5 % in 1990 , 
down from an estimated 11 % this year . In 
other in which have been moderate economic slowdowns 
-- environment 0 firm expects *T*-1 in 1990 
*T*-2 -- change in dividends ranged from a gain 
of 4 % to a decline of 1 % , 
to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger . minority argument 
, meanwhile , is that businesses have financial wherewithal 
*ICH*-2 this time around 0 * to declare sharply higher 
dividends *T*-1 even if earnings weaken . Dividend growth 
on order of 12 % is expected *-142 by 
both Mr. Coxon of Cigna Mr. Einhorn of Goldman 
Sachs . Those dividend bulls argue that corporations in 
unusual of *-2 having plenty of cash left 
over * after *-1 paying dividends making capital expenditures 
. One indicator 0 investors might want *-2 to watch 
*T*-1 is monthly tally from Standard & Poor 's 
of number of public companies adjusting dividends . 
A total of 139 companies *ICH*-1 raised dividends in October 
, unchanged from 138 a year ago , S&P 
said 0 *T*-2 Wednesday . That followed four straight 
in which number of increases trailed year-earlier pace 
*T*-1 . While S&P tally does n't measure 
magnitude of dividend changes , a slippage in 
number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower 
dividend growth next year . In any case , 
*ICH*-2 is mixed on how much of a boost 
stock market get *T*-1 even if dividend growth 
continues at double-digit . Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs 
estimates 0 stock market deliver a 12 % 
to 15 % *U* total return from dividends 
*ICH*-1 over next 12 -- vs. a `` 
cash rate of return '' of 7 % or 
8 % *U* if dividend growth is weak . But 
Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price , who *T*-235 also 
expects 12 % growth in dividends next year , does 
n't think 0 it help market all 
that much . `` * Having dividend increases is 
a supportive element in market outlook , but I 
do n't think 0 it 's a main consideration , 
'' he says *T*-1 . With slower economic growth 
flat earnings likely next year , `` I 
n't look for thw market to have much upside from 
current . Your Oct. 13 page-one story on 
renewed plight of Western says that Western had 
lost its chance * to be in telephone business

former U.S. president 's sixth visit to China , during 
which he spoke at lengh with Chinese leaders *T*-1 , 
was nowhere near as at * easing strains that 
*T*-239 have afflicted Sino-U.S. relationship . Mr. Nixon 
, most prominent American 0 *T*-1 to come to 
China since Beijing 's bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in 
June , harped on international outrage over massacre . 
Chinese , in turn , took aim at American 
`` interference '' in China 's domestic affairs . One 
official newspaper , Legal Daily , even directly criticized Mr. 
Nixon , who *T*-240 is normally referred to *T*-1 here

him of *-3 being a leading proponent of `` peaceful 
evolution , '' a catch phrase 0 * to describe 
what China believes 0 *T*-1 is policy *ICH*-4 of 
Western countries * to seduce socialist nations into capitalist 
sphere *T*-2 . tension was evident on Wednesday evening 
during Mr. Nixon 's final banquet toast , normally an 
for * reciting platitudes about eternal friendship . Instead 
, Mr. Nixon reminded his host , Chinese President Yang 
Shangkun , that Americans have n't forgiven China 's leaders 
for military assault of June 3-4 that *T*-241 killed 
hundreds , thousands , of demonstrators . `` 
in United States , including friends of 
China , 0 crackdown was excessive anf unjustified 
, '' Mr. Nixon told Mr. Yang , who *T*-242 
was directly involved *-2 in * ordering attack *T*-1 
. `` thw events of April June damaged 
respect confidence which most Americans previously had *T*-1 for 
leaders of China . '' Chinese responded in 
an equally undiplomatic fashion . In talks with Mr. Nixon 
, Chinese leaders expressed no regret for killings , 
even that U.S. was prominently involved *-1 
in demonstrations this spring . In a meeting Tuesday 
, supreme leader , Deng Xiaoping , told Mr. Nixon 
, `` * Frankly , U.S. was involved 
*-146 too deeply in turmoil counterrevolutionary rebellion which 
*T*-243 in Beijing not long ago . China was

Yang said 0 relationship had reached a `` stalemate

his wife , Li Shuxian , took refuge in 
U.S. Embassy in Beijing *T*-1 . Shortly afterwards ,

to an American member of Nixon party , 
former president raised a number of controversial issues in 
his 20 hours of talks with top-level Chinese officials . 
included China 's economic policies , human rights 
question of Mr. Fang . Mr. Nixon also proposed 
that China restore its participation in Fulbright Program , 
a U.S. government-funded academic exchange . China pulled out of 
program in July . In his talks , 
former president urged China 's leaders *-1 to acknowledge that 
nation is part of world community welcome 
infusion of outside contacts ideas . `` Ideas 
going over borders , 's no SDI 
ideological weapon that *T*-245 can shoot them down , '' 
he told a group of Americans *T*-1 at U.S. 
Embassy on Wednesday . no signs , 
, of China 's yielding on key issues . But 
in one minor matter , Mr. Nixon appears *-1 to 
have gained a concession . In a meeting with Premier 
Li Peng on Monday , Mr. Nixon said that he 
hoped 0 he n't encounter guards with machine guns 
during his visit to U.S. Embassy . Sure enough 
, whn he arrived at embassy two days 
, machine-gun-toting guards gone -- for first 
time in five . A few blocks away , 
at U.S. ambassador 's residence , guards encircling 
compound also had discarded Uzi-model arms for 
first time since early June . But guards 
retained pistols , a large contingent of plainclothes 
police remained nearby in unmarked cars . Moreover , police 
soldiers continue *-1 to harass Americans , who *T*-246

has made acquisitions in George Bush mode : 
kind gentle . question : Can he 
act more like hard-charging Teddy Roosevelt ? Mr. Hahn , 
62-year-old chairman chief executive officer of Georgia-Pacific Corp. 
is leading forest-product concern 's unsolicited $ 3.19 billion 
*U* bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp . Nekoosa has 
given offer a public cold shoulder , a reaction 
0 Mr. Hahn has n't faced *T*-2 in his 18 
earlier acquisitions , all of which *T*-3 negotiated *-1 
behind scenes . So far , Mr. Hahn is 
trying *-1 to entice Nekoosa into * negotiating a friendly 
surrender while *-1 talking tough . `` We 
*-1 to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction , '' 
he says *T*-2 . But a takeover battle opens up 
possibility of a bidding war , with all 0 
that implies *T*-1 . If a competitor enters game 
, for example , Mr. Hahn could face dilemma 
of * paying a premium for Nekoosa or seeing 
company fall into arms of a rival . *-2 
Given *-3 that , associates of Mr. Hahn 
industry observers say 0 former president -- who 
*T*-1 has developed a reputation for * not overpaying for 
anything -- fold . `` 's a price 
above which I 'm positive 0 Marshall has courage 
0 * not to pay *T*-1 *T*-3 , '' says 
*T*-2 A.D. Correll , Georgia-Pacific 's executive vice president for 
pulp paper . Says *ICH*-1 long-time associate Jerry Griffin 
, vice president , development , at WTD Industries 
Inc. : `` He is n't of old school 
of * winning at any cost . '' He also 
is a consensus manager , insiders say 0 *T*-1 . 
* to make bid for Nekoosa , 
for example , was made *-2 only after all six 
members of Georgia-Pacific 's signed onto deal 
-- even though Mr. Hahn knew 0 he *-3 
to go after company early on , says 0 
*T*-1 Mr. Correll . Associates say 0 Mr. Hahn picked 
up that careful to as president of Virginia 
Polytechnic Institute . *-1 Assuming that post at age 
of 35 , he managed by consensus , as * 
is rule in universities , says 0 *T*-3 Warren 
H. Strother , a official who *T*-2 is researching 
a book on Mr. Hahn . But he also showed 
a willingness *-1 to take a strong stand . In 
1970 , Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest 
student protesters who *T*-3 occupying a . 
That impressed Robert B. Pamplin , Georgia-Pacific 's chief executive 
at time , whom Mr. Hahn had met *T*-4 
while *-1 fundraising for institute . In 1975 , 
Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into * joining company 
as executive vice president in charge of chemicals ; 
move befuddled in Georgia-Pacific who *T*-5 did n't 
0 a administrator could make transition to thw 
world . But Mr. Hahn rose swiftly 
ranks , *-1 demonstrating a raw that he says 
0 he knew 0 he possessed *T*-2 early on . 
*-1 son of a physicist , Mr. Hahn skipped 
first grade because his reading was so far above 
his classmates . *-1 rapidly school , he 
graduated Phi Beta Kappa from of Kentucky at 
age 18 , after * spending only 2 1\/2 
in college . He earned his doctorate in nuclear physics 
from hte Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Mr. Hahn agrees 
that he has a `` retentive '' memory , but 
friends say 0 that 's an understatement . call 
it `` photographic '' . Mr. Hahn also has engineered 
a surprising turnaround of Georgia-Pacific . *-1 Taking over as 
chief executive officer in 1983 , he inherited a company 
that *T*-6 was mired *-2 in debt hurt *-2 
by a recession-inspired slide in its building-products business . Mr. 
Hahn began *-1 selling non-core businesses , such as oil 
gas chemicals . He even sold one unit 
that *T*-7 made vinyl checkbook covers . At same 
time , he began *-1 up pulp 
paper of company while *-1 refocusing products 
on home repair remodeling , rather than materials for 
new-home construction . idea was * to buffet 
products from cycles in new-home construction . formula has 
paid off , so far . Georgia-Pacific 's sales climbed 
to $ 9.5 billion *U* last year , with 
$ 6 billion *U* in 1983 , Mr. Hahn 
took reins *T*-1 . from continuing has 
soared to $ 467 million *U* from $ 75 million 
*U* . Mr. Hahn attributes gains to philosophy 
of * concentrating on what a company knows *T*-1 best 
. `` record of companies that *T*-8 have diversified 
is n't all that impressive , '' he says *T*-1 
. Nekoosa n't be a diversification . It 
be a good match , Mr. Hahn analysts 
say 0 *T*-1 , of two healthy companies with high-quality 
assets strong cash flows . company 
be largest forest-products concern in world with combined 
sales of more than $ 13 billion *U* . But 
can Mr. Hahn carry it off ? In this instance 
, industry observers say 0 *T*-1 , he is entering 
uncharted waters . Says *ICH*-1 Kathryn McAuley , an analyst 
at First Manhattan Co. : `` This is greatest 
acquisition 0 he has faced *T*-2 . A House-Senate 
approved major portions of a package for more than 
$ 500 million *U* in economic aid for Poland that 
*T*-1 relies heavily on $ 240 million *U* in 
loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of * 
stimulating future trade investment . For Agency for 
International Development , appropriators approved $ 200 million *U* in

to * adding more than $ 200 million *U* in 
economic support funds environmental initiatives sought * by 
Bush administration . agreement on Poland contrasts with 
major differences remaining over underlying foreign aid bill ,

House is sharply confined under this year 's budget 
. fiscal pressures also a factor in * 
shaping Poland package , while more ambitious authorizing

. *-1 To accommodate additional cash assistance , 
House Appropriations last week was *-1 to reallocate 
an estimated $ 140 million *U* from Pentagon . 
though size of loan guarantees approved * 
yesterday is significant , recent with a similar program 
in Central America indicates that it could take several 
new Polish can fully use aid 
effectively . action on Poland came as 
separately approved $ 220 million *U* for international population planning 
activities , an 11 % increase over fiscal 1989 . 
House Senate divided *-6 over 
United Nations Population Fund any portion of

sweeping of bill draws a of

a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle 
among sugar producing nations over fate of Panama 's

was stripped *-8 of this right because of U.S. differences 
with Noriega regime , but Central American country 
have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over 
a 21-month period ending Sept. 30 , 1990 . About 
a quarter of this share has already been reallocated *-9

. It was outrageous . it was stupid . 
theory was that Voice is a propaganda agency 
this should n't propagandize its own people . 
That sounds neat , but this -- any 
-- propagandizes its own people every day . press 
releases , speeches , briefings , tours of military facilities 
, publications all propaganda of sorts . Propaganda is 
just information 0 *T*-1 to support a viewpoint , 
beauty of a democracy is that it enables you 
to hear or read every viewpoint then make up 
your own mind on an issue . thi restrictions on 
viewing dissemination of Voice material absurd : 
An agency in information business was not being allowed 
*-1 to inform . In June 1988 , I 
in this space about this issue . *-1 Assuming 0 
it was n't one of those columns that you clipped 
*T*-2 put *T*-2 on refrigerator door , I 
'll review facts . Voice of America is 
a agency that *T*-1 broadcasts news views -- 
some might say propaganda -- in 43 languages to 130 
million listeners around thw world . It does a first-rate 
job . Its budget $ 184 million *U* -- is 
paid for *-30 by you . But a 1948 law 
barred `` dissemination '' of that material in 
U.S. . law let scholars , reporters researchers 
read texts of VOA material , only at VOA headquarters 
in Washington , but it barred them from *-1 copying 
texts . , of course , 's that 
word `` dissemination . '' How 's that *T*-1 
? `` You may come by agency *-3 to 
read but not copy either or by * photocopying 
, '' a Voice official explained *T*-1 I asked 
*T*-2 . What if I tune in my short-wave radio 
, transcribe an editorial or program , anf print it 
in my newspaper ? `` Nor you free *-2 
to reprint such material , '' I was advised *-31 
*T*-1 . That sounded a lot like censorship , so 
after of letters conversations that *T*-22 went nowhere 
, I sued . A couple of weeks ago , 
I lost case in federal district court in Des 
Moines . At least , that 's way 0 
it was reported *-32 *T*-1 . , , 
lawsuit was dismissed *-33 . But I -- I 
like *-1 to think of it in terms of we 
, all of us -- won point . For 
a funny thing happened on way to ruling 
: United States Information Agency , which *T*-23 runs 
Voice , changed its on three key points 
. -- USIA said that , on reflection , 
of course I could print anything 0 I could get 
my hands on *T*-1 . word dissemination , it 
0 *T*-1 , referred only to itself . `` 
USIA officially publicly declared absolute right *ICH*-2 
of everyone USIA * to disseminate agency program 
materials in United States , '' my lawyer , 
scholarly Mark McCormick of Des Moines , said *T*-1 
in a memo pointing out facts trying * 
to make me feel good after press reported that 
I had lost . court noted new USIA 
but , just in case , officially found `` 
that Congress did not intend *-1 to preclude plaintiffs from 
* disseminating USIA information domestically . '' -- USIA 
said that , on reflection , anyone *ICH*-2 could view 
VOA materials , not just reporters , scholars 
, researchers congressmen who *T*-1 mentioned *-34 in 
statute . `` USIA publicly officially stated 
in thi litigation that all persons allowed *-35 
to materials , notwithstanding statutory designations , because 
USIA has determined that it not check 
credentials of any person appearing requesting * to see 
materials , '' Mr. McCormick noted *T*-2 . -- 
USIA said that all of us could take 
extensive notes . `` agency publicly officially declared 
in lawsuit that persons who *T*-24 materials 
may make notes , while agency is 
that persons may not take verbatim notes , no one 
check *-3 to determine what notes a person has 
taken *T*-25 , '' Mr. McCormick reported *T*-1 . I 
had sought , in my suit , right * 
to print Voice material , which *T*-2 had been denied 
me *-36 , I had sought a right * 
to information , *-3 in effect that 
a right * to print information is n't very 
helpful if I have no right * to get 
information . But court disagreed . `` First 
Amendment proscribes from *-2 passing laws abridging 
right to free speech , '' Judge Donald O'Brien ruled 
*T*-1 . `` First Amendment does not prescribe a 
duty upon * to assure easy to 
information for members of press . '' So 
situation is this : You have a right *-2 
to read Voice of America scripts if you do n't 
mind *-1 traveling to Washington every week or so 
*-1 visiting Voice office during business hours . I 
have a right *-1 to print those scripts if I 
go laboriously -- but no longer surreptitiously -- 
copy them out in long hand . But of 
us can copy material on a Xerox machine or 
have it sent *-1 to us . In an era 
every agency has a public-relations machine that *T*-2 
sends you stuff you want it or not *T*-1 
, this does seem odd . , Judge O'Brien 
ruled that `` it *EXP*-1 be easy * to 
conclude that USIA 's is ` inappropriate or 
even stupid , ' '' but it 's law 
. So next step , I suspect 0 *T*-1 
, is * to try *-2 to get law 
changed . We -LRB- I assume 0 you 're in 
this with me at this point -RRB- need *-1 to 
get three words -- `` for only '' -- 
from law . Section 501 of United 
States Information Educational Exchange Act of 1948 says 0 
Voice material shall be availble to of us -LRB- 
but , thanks to USIA 's new 
, all of us -RRB- `` for only . 
'' If those words n't , nice 
people at Voice be able *-1 to send 
you information or , at very least , 
let you photocopy it . This is not a trivial 
issue . `` You have ... raised important questions which 
*T*-26 ought *-2 to be answered *-3 : What does 
USIA say *T*-27 about America abroad ; how do we 
say it *T*-4 ; how can American taxpayers get 
answers to questions *T*-5 ? '' a man

to revived takeover speculation , which *T*-28 has contributed to 
volatility of Campbell shares in recent . Campbell 's 
international businesses , in U.K. Italy , 
appear *-1 to be at heart of its problems 
. Growth has fallen short of targets operating earnings

, Campbell is a distant third in U.K. frozen 
foods market , where it paid 24 times earnings 
for Freshbake Foods PLC wound up with far more 
capacity than it could use *?* *T*-1 . Similarly , 
Campbell 's Italian biscuit operation , D. Lazzaroni & Co.

, both men said 0 like *-1 to

, 63 , had been under intense pressure *ICH*-1 from

plan calls for * closing at least nine plants 
eliminating about 3,600 jobs . But analysts said 0 
early results from reorganization have been , 
in Europe , signs that board 
became impatient . Campbell officials said 0 Mr. McGovern was 
n't *ICH*-2 yesterday *-1 to discuss circumstances of 
his departure . company 's statement quoted him 
as *-1 saying , `` CEO succession is well 
along I 've for personal reasons *-2 to

in October 1991 , `` unless I get fired . 
'' Campbell said 0 Mr. McGovern had withdrawn his name

Mr. Baum said 0 two have orders * to

company 's largest division , which *T*-34 posted 6 % 
unit sales growth a 15 % improvement in operating 
for fiscal 1989 . `` way that we 
've been managing Campbell U.S.A. *T*-2 can hopefully spread to

Robert L. Bernstein , chairman president of Random House 
Inc. , announced his resignation from publishing house 0 
he has run *T*-1 for 23 . A successor 
was n't named *-1 , which *T*-35 fueled speculation that 
Mr. Bernstein may have clashed with S.I. Newhouse Jr. , 
whose family company , Advance Publications Inc. , *T*-2 owns 
Random House . Abrupt departures n't unheard of *-1 
Newhouse empire . In an interview , Mr. 
Bernstein said 0 his departure `` evolved out of discussions 
with Si Newhouse that 's 0 I 
reached *T*-1 . '' He declined *-1 to elaborate , 
other than *-1 to say , `` It just seemed 
right thing 0 * to do *T*-2 at this 
minute . Sometimes you just go with your gut . 
'' Mr. Bernstein said 0 he stay until Dec. 
31 work with his successor , who *T*-36 is 
*-1 to be named *-43 soon . Mr. Newhouse , 
meanwhile , insisted that he is n't unhappy with Mr. 
Bernstein or performance of Random House , largest 
trade publishing house in U.S. . company said 
0 publisher 's sales volume increased to $ 
800 million *U* from $ 40 million *U* during Mr. 
Bernstein 's tenure . `` Bob has handled extraordinary 
growth of company quite brilliantly , '' said *T*-1 
Mr. Newhouse . `` company is doing well , 
it 's stable , it 's got good people . 
Bob has an agenda this seemed like natural 
time . '' Publishing officials that while Random House 
has enjoyed spectacular growth has smoothly integrated acquisitions 
in recent , some of bigger ones have 
n't been absorbed *-44 so . Crown Publishing Group 
, acquired * last year , is said *-1 to 
be turning in results . As a private company 
, Random House does n't report its earnings . Mr. 
Bernstein , who *T*-37 succeeded Bennett Cerf , has been 
only second president of Random House since it was 
founded *-45 in 1925 . Speculation on his successor centers 
on a number of division heads at house . 
candidates include Susan Petersen , president of Ballantine\/Del Rey\/Fawcett 
, Random House 's huge succesful paperback division . 
Some say 0 Anthony Cheetham , head of a 
acquired British company , Century Hutchinson , could be chosen 
*-46 . is also speculation that Mr. Newhouse could 
bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member 
0 *T*-1 to run business side , in combination 
with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb , who *T*-38 
left Random House 's Alfred A. Knopf *-2 to run 
New Yorker , also owned * by Newhouse 
family . Not included on most-likely-successor list Joni 
Evans , recruited * two ago * to be 
publisher of adult trade books for Random House , 
Sonny Mehta , president of prestigious Alfred A. Knopf 
unit . Ms. Evans took her job *T*-1 , 
several important divisions that *T*-2 had reported to her predecessor 
n't included *-3 partly because she did n't wish 
*-4 to be a full-time administrator . Mr. Mehta is 
viewed as a brilliant editor but a less-than-brilliant administrator 
his own departure was rumored *-47 . Mr. 
Bernstein , a tall , energetic man who *T*-39 is 
respected as a publishing executive , has spent much 
of his time in recent on human rights issues 
. Congress learned during thw Reagan administration that it could 
intimidate executive branch by *-1 uttering 
same seven words : `` Provided , that no 
funds shall be spent *-48 ... . '' This phrase 
once is found *-49 appropriations bills 
Congress . It signals Congress 's attempt 
, under pretext of * guarding public purse 
, * to deny president funding * 
to execute of his duties prerogatives specified * 
in Article II of Constitution . This species of 
congressional action is predicated *-50 on an of 
appropriations clause that *T*-1 is errounous unconstitutional . 
appropriations clause states that `` No Money shall be drawn 
*-51 from Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations 
made * by Law ... . '' prevailing 
of clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives 
Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of 
president * to withhold funding . This 
was officially endorsed *-1 by Congress in 1987 in 
Iran-Contra Report . As partisans of congressional power undersand 
, a `` power of purse '' so broadly 
construed * emasculate presidency swallow principle 
of of powers . It is not supported by 
text or history of Constitution . framers 
hardly discussed appropriations clause at Constitutional Convention of 
1787 , to Madison 's notes . To 
extent 0 did , concern was *-1 to 
ensure fiscal accountability . Moreover , framers believed that 
nation needed a unitary executive with independence 
resources 0 * to perform executive functions that 
Confederation Congress had performed *T*-2 poorly under of 
Confederation *T*-1 . It contradict that objective if 
appropriations clause -LRB- technically a limitation on legislative power -RRB- 
could be read *-52 as *-52 placing president on 
Congress 's short leash , *-52 making executive 
of president every member of Congress . As 
it went to panel deliberating , 
appropriations bill for executive office of president for 
fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts *ICH*-1 by Congress * 
to rewrite Constitution under pretext of * protecting 
public 's money . During coming weeks , 
President Bush must * to veto bills 
them -- or , alternatively , * to sign 
bills into law with a statement declaring intrusions 
on executive power to be in violation of Article II 
, thus void severable . 1990 appropriations 
legislation attempts *-1 to strip president of his powers 
* to make as * provided *-2 by 
Article II . Article II places on president 
duty * to nominate *RNR*-1 , `` by 
with Advice Consent of Senate '' appoint 
*RNR*-1 , ambassadors , judges , other officers of 
hte U.S. . It also empowers president to make 
recess , without Senate approval : `` President 
shall have Power * to fill up all Vacancies that 
*T*-1 may happen during Recess of Senate , 
by *-2 granting Commissions which *T*-40 shall expire at 
End of next . '' Yet Section 605 
of appropriations bill for executive office provides : 
`` No part of any appropriation for hte current fiscal 
year contained * in this or any other Act shall 
be paid *-53 to any person for filling of 
any for which he or she has been nominated 
*-54 *T*-1 after Senate has voted *-2 not to 
approve nomination of said person . '' Thus , 
with one passage in an appropriations bill , Congress 
repeals president 's power * to make recess 
under Article II . Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions 
on president 's * to nominate candidates of 
his . language of appropriations rider implies 
that any nomination to any of a rejected nominee 
result in president being denied *-55 funding 0 
* to pay that person 's salary *T*-1 . 
president could probably not avoid this restriction by *-1 
people willing * to serve without pay , because 
Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits service to . 
1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of `` muzzling 
'' provisions that *T*-1 violate recommendation clause in Article 
II of Constitution . Muzzling provisions , which *T*-1 
might be called *-56 `` blindfold laws '' as well 
, prevent executive branch from even *-2 looking at 
policy options , let alone from *-2 them 
to Congress . Such laws violate provision in Article 
II that *T*-1 requires president to make recommendations to 
Congress , but which *T*-41 gives president 
0 * to select subject matter of those recommendations 
*T*-2 . Typically , laws seek *-1 to prevent 
executive branch officials from *-2 inquiring into federal 
programs make any economic or proposing more market-oriented alternatives 
to regulations . Probably most egregious example is a 
in appropriations bill for executive office that 
*T*-1 prevents president 's Office of Budget 
from *-2 subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny 
. is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting 
executive from *-1 even public funds 
being wasted *-57 in some favored program or other . 
none of unconstitutional conditions contained * in 
appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better *ICH*-1 illustrates Congress 's 
attempt * to usurp executive power than Section 609 of 
executive-office bill : `` None of funds made 
* pursuant to provisions of this Act shall 
be used *-2 * to implement , administer , or 
enforce any regulation which *T*-3 has been disapproved *-58 pursuant 
to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted * in accordance 
with law of United States . '' 
This provision amounts to a legislative veto over president 
's execution of law , since a one-house resolution 
could be said *-1 to be `` duly adopted '' 
even though it require bicameral action in Congress 
nor presentation to president for his signature or veto 
. Supreme Court 's in INS v. Chadha 
held that legislative vetoes unconstitutional . President Bush should 
veto appropriations acts that *T*-1 contain kinds of unconstitutional 
conditions on president 's * to discharge his 
duties exercise his prerogatives . If President Bush 
*-1 to do so in his first year , he 
invite Congress , for thi remainder of his presidency 
, *-2 to rewrite Article II of Constitution *-3 
to suit its purposes . What *T*-1 becomes custom in 
Bush administration wil only become more 0 for 
future presidents , including Democrats , to undo *T*-2 . 
President Reagan learned that lesson . By 1987 , then-Speaker 
Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail 
Gorbachev then attempting *-1 to direct president , 
an appropriations rider , *-2 to treat Soviets 
as though Senate had ratified SALT II . If 
a veto is unworkable because it leave part of 
executive branch unfunded , president could sign hte 
appropriations bills into law assert a power of excision 
, *-1 declaring rider restricting his Article II powers 
to be unconstitutional severable . Constitution does not 
expressly give president such power . , 
president does have a duty * not to violate 
Constitution . question is his only of 
defense is veto . Excision of appropriations riders that 
*T*-1 trespass on president 's duties prerogative under 
Article II be from line-item veto . 
As * discussed in context of * controlling federal 
spending , line-item veto is characterized *-59 as a 
way 0 for president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions 
in a spending bill that *T*-2 objectionable merely because 
conflict with his policy objectives *T*-1 . excision 
of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill be a 
power of far more limited applicability . One could argue 
that it *EXP*-1 is not an assertion of a item 
veto at all for president , by *-2 exerting 
a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in 
legislation that *T*-3 violate of powers . 
is no downside if president asserts a right of 
excision over unconstitutional conditions in fiscal 1990 appropriations bills 
. If Congress does nothing , President Bush have 
won . If Congress takes dispute to hte Supreme 
Court -LRB- *-2 assuming 0 it can establish standing 0 
* to sue *T*-1 -RRB- , President Bush might win 
. In that case , he might an 
*ICH*-2 from court that *T*-1 is a vindication of 
president 's right * to perform duties 
exercise prerogatives 0 framers thought 0 *T*-3 should 
be entrusted *-60 to executive . If President Bush 
loses at court , it might be , 
as Morrison v. Olson was *?* for Reagan administration 
. But presidency be no worse off than 
it is *?* . Moreover , electorate 
have received a civics lesson in how 
of powers works in practice *T*-1 . As it stands 
, Congress presumes after Reagan administration that 
White House take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills *-1 
lying down . President Bush should things straight . 
If he does not , he help *-1 realize 
Madison 's fear in Federalist No. 48 of a 
legislature `` everywhere extending sphere of its activity 
drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex . '' Mr. 
Sidak served as an attorney in Reagan administration . 
His longer of executive power appropriations clause 
is *-1 to appear in Duke Law Journal 
this year . Despite one of most devastating droughts 
on record , net cash income in Farm Belt 
rose to a new high of $ 59.9 billion *U* 
last year . previous record was $ 57.7 billion 
*U* in 1987 , to Agriculture Department . 
Net cash income -- amount left * in farmers 
' pockets after * deducting expenses from gross cash income 
-- increased in 33 states in 1988 , as 
drought cut into crop yields drove up commodity prices 
, department 's Economic Research Service reported 0 *T*-1 
yesterday . Most of those states farm income records 
. worst crop damage in Midwestern Corn 
Belt northern Great Plains . What *T*-42 saved 
farmers from a bad year was * 
to reclaim large quantities of grain anf other crops that 
had `` mortgaged '' *T*-1 to under 
price-support loan programs . With prices soaring , 
able *-1 to sell reclaimed commodities at `` 
, '' agency 's 240-page report said 0 
*T*-2 . In less parched areas , meanwhile , farmers 
who *T*-43 had little or no loss of production profited 
greatly from higher prices . To surprise of 
some analysts , net cash income rose in some of 
hardest-hit states , including Indiana , Illinois , Nebraska 
Dakotas . Analysts attributed increases partly to 
$ 4 billion *U* disaster-assistance package enacted * by 
Congress . Last year 's record net cash income confirms 
farm sector 's rebound from agricultural depression of 
early 1980s . It also helps *-2 explain 
reluctance *ICH*-1 of major farm lobbies lawmakers 
* to make any significant changes in 1985 farm 
program next year . Commodity prices have been rising in 
recent , with farm price index hitting record 
peaks earlier this year , as curtailed production 
with land-idling programs *-1 to reduce price-depressing surpluses . At 
same time , export demand for U.S. wheat , 
corn other commodities strengthened , said *T*-1 Keith Collins 
, a department analyst . Farmers also benefited from strong 
livestock prices , as nation 's cattle inventory dropped 
close to a 30-year low . `` All of 
forces came togehter in 1988 * to agriculture , 
'' Mr. Collins said *T*-1 . California led nation 
with $ 6.5 billion *U* in net cash income last 
year , followed by Texas , $ 3.9 billion *U* 
; Iowa , $ 3.4 billion *U* ; Florida , 
$ 3.1 billion *U* ; Minnesota , $ 2.7 
billion *U* . Iowa Minnesota among few 
major farm states 0 *T*-1 to log a decline in 
net cash income . Despite federal disaster relief , 
drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an 
estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers , to department 
. lost farms . Department economists do n't 
expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 
was *?* . , net cash income is likely 
*-1 to fall this year as farm expenses rise 
payments to farmers decline . At same time 
, an increase of land under cultivation after drought 
has boosted production of corn , soybeans other commodities 
, * causing a fall in prices that *T*-2 has 
been only partly cushioned *-3 by heavy grain buying by 
thw Soviets . Last year , goverment payments to farmers 
slipped to less than $ 14.5 billion *U* from a 
record $ 16.7 billion *U* in 1987 . Payments 
expected *-1 to range $ 9 billion *U* 
$ 12 billion *U* this year . After of

, Hearst Corp. , following unsuccessful efforts * to sell 
venerable newspaper . demise of 238,000-circulation Herald 
, once nation 's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation 
exceeding 700,000 , turns country 's second-largest city into 
a one-newspaper town , at least in some senses . 
Los Angeles Times , with a circulation of more 
than 1.1 million , dominates region . But it 
faces stiff competition in Orange County from Orange County

Los Angeles Daily News , which *T*-45 sells more than 
170,000 . Nearby cities such as Pasadena Long Beach 
also have large dailies . In July , closely held 
Hearst , based * in New York , put 
paper on block . Speculation had it that 
company was asking $ 100 million *U* for an operation 
said * to be losing about $ 20 million *U* 
a year , but others said 0 Hearst might have 
given paper away . An attempted buy-out led 
* by John J. McCabe , chief operating officer , 
never materialized , a stream of what one staff 
member dismissed *T*-1 as `` tire-kickers lookee-loos '' had 
filed since . prospective buyers included investor Marvin 
Davis Toronto Sun . death of 
Herald , a newsstand paper in a freeway town , 
was inevitable . Los Angeles is a sprawling , 
balkanized newspaper market , advertisers seemed *-1 to feel 
0 could buy space in mammoth Times , 
then target a area with one of regional 
dailies . Herald was left *-61 in limbo . 
, Herald seemed *-1 torn editorially *-3

necessarily represent condition of newspaper industry . 
`` Herald was a survivor from a bygone age

analyst with PaineWebber Inc . `` Actually , long 
deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of * coming to 
an end , industry looks pretty healthy .

Hearst , Herald was crippled *-64 by a bitter 
, decade-long strike that *T*-1 began in 1967 cut 
circulation in half . , it never recovered ; 
editorially , it had its moments . In 1979 , 
Hearst hired editor James Bellows , who *T*-48 brightened 
editorial product considerably . He his successor , Mary 
Anne Dolan , restored respect for editorial product , 
though in recent paper had been limping 
along on limited resources , its accomplishments notable . 
For example , Herald consistently beat its much-larger rival 
on disclosures about Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley 's financial 
dealings . Herald 's sports coverage arts 
also highly regarded . Robert J. Danzig , vice

In most of British , municipalities agreed

Since October 's minicrash , Wall Street has been shaken 
*-69 by an explosion of resentment against program trading , 
computer-driven , lightning-fast trades of huge baskets of stocks 
futures that *T*-1 can send stock prices reeling in 
. But heated fight over program trading is 
about much more than a volatile stock market . 
real battle is over who *T*-1 control that market

to academics who *T*-64 have studied it , 
is merely caught *-1 in middle of this battle 
, *-1 unfairly labeled *-2 as evil driving force 
of marketplace . evidence indicates that program trading 
did n't , in fact , cause market 's 
sharp fall on Oct. 13 , though it may have 
exacerbated it . On one side of this power struggle 
stand *T*-1 forces in ascendency on Wall Street --

make markets in stocks . So far , Wall 
Street 's Old Guard seems *-1 to be winning 
program-trading battle , *-2 successfully mobilizing public congressional 
*-3 to bludgeon tormentors . Chicago Mercantile Exchange 
, a major futures marketplace , yesterday announced addition 
of another layer of trading halts designed * to slow 
program traders during a rapidly falling stock market , 
Big Board is expected today *-70 to approve some 
additional restrictions on program trading . *-1 Stung by charges 
that greed is turning stock market into a 
gigantic crapshoot , almost all big investment banking houses 
have abandoned index arbitrage , a common form of program 
trading , for own in past few 
days . A few , such as giant Merrill Lynch 
& Co. , refuse *-1 even to do index 
arbitrage trades for clients . Old Guard 's assault 
on program trading its practitioners has been fierce 
broad-based , in part because some Old Guard members feel 
0 very livelihood is at stake . Some , 
such as traditional money manager Neuberger & Berman , have 
taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators `` 
stop racket on Wall Street . '' Big 
Board stock specialists , in a bold palace revolt , 
began shortly after Oct. 13 *-1 to telephone corparate 
executives of companies whose stock *T*-2 is listed *-71 
on Big Board *-3 to have them pressure 
exchange to ban program trading . Charles Wohlstetter , 
chairman of Contel Corp. who *T*-66 is rallying other CEOs 
to anti-program trading cause , says 0 he has 
received `` countless '' letters offering support . `` 
said , without a single exception : * Do 
n't even compromise . * Kill it , '' he 
says *T*-1 . Wall Street 's New Guard is n't 
likely *-1 to take all this *-2 lying down for 
long , . Its new products anf trading 
have been highly profitable . Program trading money managers have 
gained control over a big chunk of invested funds 
in this country , pressures *ICH*-2 on such 
money managers * to produce consistent proffits has wedded them

*T*-67 's more , last time 0 major Wall 
Street firms said 0 getting out of program 
trading *T*-1 -- in aftermath of 1987 crash

into it . Even some members of Old Guard

conceding that future belongs with New Guard . 
Last week , Robert M. Bradley , one of 
Big Board 's most respected floor traders anf head of

his exchange seat a bitter letter to Big

Just a blind fear of unknown is causing them 
to beg regulators for protection . '' For all 
furor , is nothing complex about 
concept of stock-index arbitrage , most controversial type of 
computer-assisted program trading . Like other forms of arbitrage , 
it merely seeks *-1 to take advantage of momentary discrepancies 
in thw price of a single product -- in this 
case , a basket of stocks -- in markets

Chicago futures markets . That divergence is what stock 
index traders seek *T*-69 . it occurs *T*-1 ,

, which *T*-70 can involve purchase or sale of 
millions of dollars of stock , occur in a matter 
of seconds . A program trade of $ 5 million

Take traditional money managers , or `` stock pickers

higher fees for smaller investors . Yet such managers 
consistently fail *-2 to even keep up with *RNR*-1 ,

top practitioners *T*-1 Wall Street blue bloods : Morgan 
Stanley & Co. , Kidder Peabody , Merrill Lynch , 
Salomon Brothers Inc. PaineWebber Group Inc . But then 
came Oct. 13 negative publicity orchestrated * by 
Old Guard , against index arbitrage . 
indexers ' strategy for moment is * to hunker 
down let furor die . `` 's 
a lynch-mob psychology right , '' says *T*-1 
top program-trading official at a Wall Street firm . `` 
Wall Street 's cash cow has been gored *-1 , 
but I do n't think 0 anyone has proven that 
index arbitrage is . '' Too much money 
*ICH*-1 is at stake for program traders to give up 
. For example , stock-index futures began trading in Chicago 
in 1982 , two 
fastest-growing futures contract ever launched * . Stock futures trading 
has minted dozens of millionaires in 20s 30s 
. noe , on a good day , Chicago 's 
stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than 
Big Board trades in stock . stage 
is *-76 for battle to play out . 
anti-programmers getting some helpful thunder from Congress . 
Program traders ' `` power * to create total panic 
is so great that ca n't be allowed *-1 
to have way , '' says 0 *T*-2 Rep. 
Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat . `` We have 
*-1 to have a that *T*-2 says to those 
largest investors : ` * Sit down ! You 
not panic , you not put financial 
in jeopardy . ' '' But prospects for legislation 
that *T*-1 targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon . 
people , including Big Board , think that 
it 's too late * to put genie back 
in bottle . Big Board 's directors meet 
today *-1 to approve some program-trading restrictions , but a 
total ban is n't being considered *-77 , Big Board 
officials say 0 *T*-2 . `` You 're not going 
*-2 to stop idea of * trading a basket 
of stocks , '' says *T*-1 Vanderbilt 's Prof. Stoll 
. `` Program trading is here *-1 to stay , 
computers here *-2 to stay , we 
just need *-3 to it . '' Short of 
a total ban , some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground 
reforms , which say 0 *T*-1 take away 
advantages 0 program traders enjoy *T*-2 in 
marketplace that other investors do n't *T*-3 . One such 
proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in margin 
requirement -- or thi `` good-faith '' payment of cash 
needed * to trade them -- to about same 
as margin requirement for stocks . , 
margins on stock futures purchases much lower -- roughly 
7 % with 50 % for stocks -- * 
making futures market much faster potentially more speculative 
. Program trading critics also want Federal Reserve Board 
, rather than futures industry , to such 
margins . Futures traders respond that low margins help *-1 
keep markets active . Higher margins chase away 
dozens of smaller traders who *T*-72 help larger traders buy 
sell , say *T*-1 . Another proposed reform 
is * to have program traders answer to an `` 
uptick rule '' a reform instituted * after Great 
Crash of 1929 that *T*-1 protects against stocks being relentlessly 
beaten *-2 downward by those seeking * to from 
lower prices , namely short sellers . Big Board 
's uptick rule prevents short sale of a stock 
stock is falling in price *T*-1 . But 
in 1986 , program traders received what *T*-73 amounted to 
an exemption from uptick rule in situations , 
* to make it *EXP*-1 easier * to link 
stock futures markets . A reinstatement of uptick 
rule for program traders slow activity considerably . 
Program traders argue that a reinstatement of rule 
destroy `` pricing efficiency '' of futures 
stock markets . James A. White contributed to this article 
. Fundamentalists Jihad Big Board Chairman John Phelan said yesterday 
that he could support * letting federal regulators suspend program 
trading during wild stock-price swings . Thus band-wagon psychology 
of recent days picks up new impetus . Index arbitrage 
is a common form of program trading . As * 
usually practiced *-1 it takes advantage of a rather basic 
concept : Two markets in locations , trading 
same widgets , ca n't trade them for 
long at prices that *T*-74 . In 
index arbitrage , widget is S&P 500 , 
its price is constantly futures market 
in Chicago stock markets largely in New York 
. *-1 To from an index-arbitrage , 
who *T*-75 owns S&P 500 widget in New York 
must sell it replace it with a cheaper S&P 
500 widget in Chicago . If money manager performing 
this service is being paid by his clients *-78 to 
match or beat return of S&P 500 index 
, he is likely *-1 to remain fully invested at 
all times . -LRB- Few , if any , index-fund 
managers risk *-1 leveraging performance by *-1 owning more 
than 100 % exposure to stocks , equally few 
want *-2 to own less than a 100 % 
should stocks rise . -RRB- By *-1 constantly seeking 
*-2 to own cheapest widget , index-arbitrage traders hope 
*-1 to add 1 % 3 % *U* 
to return of S&P 500 . That 
represents a very thin `` excess '' return , certainly 
far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim *-1 
to seek *T*-2 as performance objective . fact 
that a vast of fundamentalist money managers fail *-1 
to beat S&P 500 may contribute to hysteria 
issue . As more managers pursue index-arbitrage 
strategy , small opportunities markets be reduced 
*-1 , , *-1 . current 
opportunities arise because process for * executing a buy 
or sell order in actual stocks that *T*-76 make 
up S&P 500 is more cumbersome than * transacting 
in futures market . New York Stock Exchange 
's attempt * to introduce a new portfolio basket is 
evidence of investors ' desires * to make fast 
easy of large of shares . So if 
index arbitrage is simply * taking advantage of thin inefficiencies 
two markets for same widget , how did 
`` program trading '' evolve into evil creature that 
*T*-2 is evoking curses of so observers *T*-1 
? All arguments against program trading , even those pressed 
* without fact , conclude with three expected results after 
`` reforms '' implemented *-1 : 1 -RRB- reduced 
volatility , 2 -RRB- a long-term investment focus , 
3 -RRB- a leval playing field for small investor 
. But of reforms unneeded , even 
harmful . * Reducing volatility . An index-arbitrage trade is 
never unless is difference markets 
in New York Chicago 0 *T*-1 to cover all 
transaction costs . Arbitrage does n't cause volatility ; it 
responds to it . * Think about what *T*-1 causes 
difference in prices two markets for S&P 
500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a 
buy or sell in Chicago . A large investor 
likely cause futures market to decline he sells 
his futures *T*-1 . Arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure 
from Chicago to New York , while *-1 functioning as 
a buyer in Chicago . start of whole 
process is key - must fundamentally increase or 
decrease his ownership in widgets *-1 to make widget prices 
move . Why does this large hypothetical seller trade in 
Chicago instead of New York *T*-1 ? he is 
willing *-1 to sacrifice to arbitrage trader some small 
in order *-1 to get quick execution 
of his large trade . In a competitive market , 
this investor has ways 0 * to execute his 
*T*-1 , he have more alternatives -LRB- 
both foreign domestic -RRB- if his volume is profitable 
0 for an exchange to *T*-2 . If not 
Chicago , then in New York ; if not 
U.S. , then overseas . Volatility his trades occurs 
not because of index arbitrage , but because his is 
a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with 
finite liquidity . * Eliminate arbitrage liquidity decline 
instead of * rising , * creating more volatility instead 
of less . speed of his transaction is n't 
*-1 to be feared *-79 either , because faster 
cleaner execution is desirable , not loathsome . If * 
slowing things down could reduce volatility , stone tablets should 
become trade ticket of future . * Encouraging 
long-term investing . We must be very cautious about * 
labeling investors as `` long-term '' or `` short-term . 
'' Policies designed * to one type of investor 
over another akin to * placing a sign *ICH*-1 
over Big Board 's door saying : `` Buyers 
welcome , sellers please * go away ! '' 
ultimate goal of any investor is a motive , 
regulators should not concern themselves with investors 
sufficiently focused on long term . A free market 
with a motive attract each investor to 
liquidity risks 0 he can tolerate *T*-1 . In 
point of fact , volatility as * measured *-2 by 
annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has 
frequently been much higher than it is *?* today . 
Periods advent of futures or program trading 
more volatile , usually fundamental market conditions 
undergoing change *T*-1 -LRB- 1973-75 , 1937-40 , 1928-33 
for example -RRB- . It *EXP*-2 is * to 
see fundamental stock pickers scream `` foul '' on 
program trading markets decline *T*-1 , while *-3 
hailing great values still abounding as markets rise 
. Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about 
economics of stocks , instead of evil deeds 
of program-trading goblins ? Some of proposed fixes for 
what *T*-1 is labeled *-80 `` program-trading volatility '' could 
be far worse than perceived . In * 
using program trading as a whipping boy , fundamentalist investors 
stand *-1 to gain high ground in * wooing 
small investors for existing stock-selection products . may 
, , risk *-1 bringing some damaging interference from 
outside markets themselves . How does a nice new 
tax , say 5 % , on any financial transaction 
sound *T*-1 ? That ought *-1 to make sure 0 
we 're all thinking for long term . * 
Getting a playing field . This argument is 
most one for * abolishing program trading -- 
not because of its merits , but because of 
firms championing cause . loudest of reformers 
money managers who *T*-77 cater to smaller investors . 
clients on which individual stocks * 
to buy or sell *T*-1 , while clients continue 
*-2 to hope for superior performance . Even with mutual 
funds , little investor continues *-1 to tolerate high 
fees , high commissions poor performance , while index-fund 
managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees , 
lower commissions less risk . Yet our efforts 
somehow less noble than those of an investment expert studiously 
devouring press clippings on each company 0 he follows *T*-1 
. Almost all new regulation is introduced *-81 in 
interests of * protecting little guy , he 
invariably is one least able * to cope with 
its consequences . If spreads from index arbitrage 
so enormous , surely any sizable mutual-fund company could 
from * offering it to small investors . sad 
reality is that retail investor continues *-1 to pursue 
stellar performers first , while *-2 leaving institutions to grapple 
with basis points of performance on large sums of money 
quarter by quarter *PPA*-3 . Cost-effective index funds just 
n't sexy enough * to justify high fees 
commissions that retail customers frequently pay *T*-1 , that 
institutional customers refuse *-3 to pay *T*-2 . Each new 
trading roadblock is likely *-1 to be beaten *-82 by 
institutions seeking better ways 0 * to serve high-volume 
clients *T*-2 , here or overseas . * Legislating new 
trading inefficiencies only make things harder on least 
sophisticated investors . So what *T*-78 is next for program 
trading ? *-1 Left *-3 to its own devices , 
index arbitrage become more more efficient , *-1 
making it harder harder 0 * to do *T*-2 
profitably . Spreads become so tight that it wo 
n't matter which market an investor chooses *T*-79 -- arbitrage 
prevent him from *-1 any temporary . 
If or private watchdogs insist , , on

about new stadiums , ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio

sports complexes be moneymakers for ther city . Pepperdine 
economist Dean Baim scoffs at that . He has 
looked at 14 baseball football stadiums found that 
only one -- private Dodger Stadium -- brought more money 
*ICH*-1 into a city than it took out . Stadiums 
tend *-1 to redistribute existing wealth a community ,

that if stadium was such a good idea

Wall Street 's big securities firms face prospect of 
* having ratings lowered . hte reason : 
Risks from firms ' new `` merchant banking '' 
activities rising as revenue from industry 's traditional 
business erodes . downgrading of debt issued * by 
CS First Boston Inc. , parent of First Boston Corp. 
, by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. , * coupled 
* with a Moody 's that Shearson Lehman Hutton 
Holdings Inc. is under review for a downgrade , 
sent shivers brokerage community this week . With 
shudders came *T*-2 realization that some of Wall 
Street 's biggest players struggling *-1 to maintain 
stellar standing * to finance activities profitably 
. Securities firms among biggest issuers of 
paper , or short-term IOUs , which sell 
*T*-1 *-2 to finance daily . biggest 
firms still retain highest ratings on paper 
. But Moody 's warned that Shearson 's paper 
rating could be lowered *-1 soon , a move that 
*T*-2 reduce Shearson 's margins on its borrowings 
signal trouble ahead for other firms . Shearson is 
62%-owned by American Express Co . `` Just as 
1980s bull market transformed U.S. securities business , so 
too *?* more environment of 1990s 
, '' says *T*-1 Christopher T. Mahoney , a Moody 
's vice president . `` A sweeping restructuring of 
industry is . '' Standard & Poor 's Corp. 
says 0 First Boston , Shearson Drexel Burnham Lambert 
Inc. , in , likely *-1 to have 
*-2 shoring up standing in ahead 
. What *T*-1 worries credit-rating concerns most is that 
Wall Street firms taking long-term risks with own 
capital via leveraged buy-out junk bond financings . That 
's a departure from traditional practice of * transferring 
almost all financing risks to investors . conventional securities 
financings structured *-3 to be sold *-1 quickly , 
Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs junk 
bonds is in long-term lending commitments that *T*-2 stretch 
out for or . `` recent disarray 
in junk bond market suggests that brokers may become 
longer-term creditors than anticipated may face long delays 
'' in * getting money back , says 0 
*T*-2 Jeffrey Bowman , a vice president at S&P , 
which *T*-1 raised a warning flag for industry in 
April it downgraded CS First Boston *T*-3 . `` 
Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation , '' says 
*T*-1 Mr. Mahoney of Moody 's . Merchant banking , 
where firms own money *T*-1 , `` is 
getting riskier , 's less of it 0 
*T*-2 to go around . '' In addition , he 
says *T*-3 *ICH*-2 , buy-out business is under pressure 
`` because of junk bond collapse , '' * 
meaning that returns likely *-1 to decline as 
volume of junk-bond financings shrinks . In a leveraged buy-out 
, a small group of investors acquires a company in 
a transaction financed * largely by borrowing , with 
expectation that debt be paid *-1 with funds 
* by acquired company 's or sales 
of its assets . In a recent report , Moody 
's said 0 it `` expects intense competition to occur 
thw rest of century in securities industry 
, which *T*-1 , combined with overcapacity , create 
poor prospects for profitability . '' It said that 
`` temptation *ICH*-2 for managements * to ease this 
pressure by *-1 taking greater risks is an additional rating 
factor . '' Both Moody 's S&P cited First 
Boston 's reliance in recent on merchant banking , 
which *T*-1 has been responsible for a significant portion of 
closely held firm 's . recent cash 
squeeze at Campeau Corp. , First Boston 's most lucrative 
client of decade , is proving costly to First 
Boston because it more than $ 3 billion *U* 
of high-yield , high-risk junk financings for Campeau units . 
In addition , a big loan that First Boston made 
*T*-2 to Ohio Mattress Co . was n't repaid on 
time its $ 450 million *U* junk financing for 
a buy-out of bedding company was withdrawn *-1 *T*-3 
. `` two exposures alone represent a very substantial 
portion of CS First Boston 's equity , '' Moody 
's said *T*-1 . `` Total merchant banking exposures 
in excess of firm 's equity . '' CS 
First Boston , , from backing of 
its largest shareholder , Suisse , Switzerland 's third 
largest bank . Shearson also has been an aggressive participant 
in leveraged buy-out business . But its earnings became 
a major disappointment as its traditional retail , or individual 
investor , business showed no signs of * rebounding from 
slump that *T*-1 followed October 1987 stock market 
crash . In addition , Shearson 's listed $ 2 
billion *U* of capital is overstated *-1 , to 
rating concerns , because it includes $ 1.7 billion 
*U* of goodwill . Shearson `` relley only has $ 
300 million *U* of capital , '' says *T*-1 Mr. 
Bowman of S&P . A Shearson spokesman said 0 
firm is n't worried . `` A year ago , 
Moody 's also had Shearson under review for downgrade 
, '' he said *T*-1 . `` After two 
of talks , our rating was maintained *-1 . '' 
Drexel , meanwhile , already competes at a disadvantage to 
its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly 
lower paper rating . collapse of junk bond 
prices of junk bond financings apparently 
have taken toll on closely held Drexel , 
leading underwriter in that market . firm also has 
been hit *-1 with big financial settlements with 
stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related * 
to a big insider-trading scandal . Drexel this year 
its retail or individual customer business , *-1 cutting 
firm 's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000 
. , Drexel circulated a private financial statement *ICH*-1 
among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has 
diminished this year from previous . firm 's 
capital , moreover , has n't grown at same 
rate as in past , officials at firms 
say 0 *T*-1 . Drexel remains confident of its future 
creditworthiness . `` We 're well positioned *-2 with $ 
1.7 billion *U* of capital , '' a Drexel spokesman 
said 0 *T*-1 . `` as a leading investment 
merchant banking firm , fact that we 
no longer subject to uncertainties vicissitudes of 
retail business is a major plus in our view .

to legal absurdity stretched another notch this week 
Supreme Court refused *-2 to hear an from a 
case that *T*-1 says 0 defendants must pay damages 
even after *-3 proving that could not possibly have 
caused harm . We can share 
compassion that *T*-2 makes judges sometimes wish *-3 to offer 
a kind of Solomonic aid to those who *T*-4 've 
been hurt *-1 . But this case is a stark 
lesson in how failures of traditional policy-making process 
have left courts as only forum 0 this 
country has *T*-2 0 * to debate risk , technology 
innovation *T*-3 *T*-1 . Too , a 
single court becomes precedent for other , less 
compelling cases . From 1940s until 1971 , some 
two million women took synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol -LRB- DES 
-RRB- *-1 to prevent miscarriages morning sickness . 
drug was approved *-1 by Food Drug Administration 
marketed *-1 by some 300 pharmaceutical companies , 
under generic labels . In 1970s , scientists reported 
cancer cases among daughters of DES users . 
cases quickly went to court , but mothers of 
several thousand DES plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand 
used *T*-1 . * in 1980 , courts in 
several states including California New York *-2 to 
suspend common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that 
defendants ones who *T*-1 liable . Courts 
made assumption that all DES pills essentially 
same , created a market-share test so that damages 
be assessed *-1 against drug makers in proportion 
of share of original sales . This has 
some logic . Drug makers should n't be able *-2 
to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which 
identical drug *T*-3 was used *-1 . But courts quickly 
tumbled down a slippery slope . Just as all plaintiffs 
not alike , it turns out that DES defendants 
marketed drugs differently may have offered warranties 
. ultimate result came in Hymowitz v. Lilly , 
where highest New York court expanded market-share 
for first time * to say that drug makers 
that *T*-1 could prove 0 Mindy Hymowitz 's mother did 
n't use pill must still pay share of 
any damages *T*-2 . But as Duke law professor 
William Van Alstyne notes , by this reasoning a defendant 
could be held *-1 liable in New York for a 
bad apple even if he sold all his apples in 
California . Despite Supreme Court 's refusal * to 
hear case , serious constitutional issues of 
due process uncompensated takings from defendants . 
big , , is that 's no 
guarantee that this reasoning be limited *-1 to DES 
or to drugs . here goes well beyond 
* twisting legal doctrine . California Supreme Court last 
year reversed direction *-1 to make it *EXP*-2 much harder 
* to win DES cases because justices saw how 
all pharmaceutical litigation has chilled introduction of new 
drugs *T*-3 . court rejected strict liability for prescription 
drugs , *-1 citing huge , hidden social costs 
. `` Public policy favors development marketing of 
new drugs , even though some risks , 
serious ones , might accompany introduction because drugs can 
save lives reduce pain , '' 
unanimous court said *T*-1 . California justices noted that 
fear of litigation already forced only remaining anti-morning-sickness 
drug , Bendectin , off U.S. market . This 
raises key issue : What * to do *T*-2 
about people who *T*-1 suffer serious injuries from drugs 
? We know that * holding drug makers liable 
where 's no evidence that or anyone else 
knew of any risks *T*-1 only 0 drugs 
wo n't be to anyone . As liability expert 
Peter Huber tells us , after Hymowitz case , 
if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug `` it 
's time 0 * to sell that company 's stock 
short *T*-1 . '' We also know that tort 
is a lousy way 0 * to compensate victims 
*T*-1 anyway ; some win legal lottery , others 
get much less contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut 
either way . DES daughters other victims of drugs 
be better off if cases taken *-1 
out of courts . Congress could create a compensation 
program 0 *T*-1 to help such victims while *-2 protecting 
national in * encouraging new drugs . But 
a 1986 law that *T*-1 replaced lawsuits over children 
's vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to 
even more litigation . Everyone by understands that Congress 
is utterly incapable of * writing legislation 0 * to 
help deserving people *T*-1 without its becoming some billion-dollar morass 
. We have no 0 this is one reason 
0 judges in New York justices on Supreme 
Court willing *-1 to trash law in 
DES cases . must figure that justice has *-2

it wo n't be done *-1 by Congress . Odyssey

people here who *T*-1 have strong contacts with Brazilian

, Thomas Spiegel , who *T*-1 $ 12.7 
billion *U* Beverly Hills , Calif. , thrift with high-yield 
junk bonds . Bears have targeted Columbia 's stock because 
of thrift 's exposure to shaky junk market 
. some investors fault Mr. Spiegel 's life style 
; he earns millions of dollars a year flies 
around in Columbia 's jet planes . Columbia stock 
hit 4 1\/8 , after * 11 3\/4 earlier 
this year on rumors that Mr. Spiegel take 
thrift private . Moreover , junk professionals think Columbia 's 
huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $ 4.4 
billion *U* was n't enough , * meaning 0 another 
markdown could be coming . But in recent days , 
Columbia has edged up , *-1 closing at 5 1\/4 
, up 3\/8 , yesterday on revived speculation that 
thrift might restructure . Mr. Spiegel 's fans say 0 
Columbia 's California branches highly salable , 
thrift has $ 458 million *U* of shareholders equity 
underlying its assets . That 's almost $ 10 *U* 
of equity for each Columbia share , including convertible preferred 
shares , though more junk markdowns reduce cushion 
. Columbia has only about 10 million common shares in 
public hands . Spiegel family has 25 % of 
common 75 % of votes . Other 
big common holders Carl Lindner 's American Financial , 
investor Irwin Jacobs Pacific Financial Research , though 
latter cut its stake this summer . While problems 
attend a restructuring of Columbia , investors say 0 
Mr. Spiegel is mulling such a plan 0 * to 
mitigate Columbia 's junk problems *T*-1 . , Columbia 
executives told reporters 0 interested in * 
creating a unit 0 *T*-1 to hold Columbia 's 
junk bonds do merchant banking . Columbia wo 
n't comment on all speculation . But like other 
thrifts , it 's expected *-1 to seek regulators ' 
consent * to create a distinct junk-bond entity . Plans 
* to do this due * to be filed 
*-1 in a week or so . New rules force 
thrifts to write down junk to market value , 
then sell bonds over five yesars . That 's 
why Columbia just off $ 130 million *U* of 
its junk reserved $ 227 million *U* for future 
junk losses *T*-1 . But if Columbia could keep its 
junk bonds from thrift till mature -- 
at full value , unless issuer goes bust or 
restructures -- junk portfolio might do all right . 
Columbia , a longtime Drexel client , wo n't 
current on its junk . But its 17 big 
junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds 
that *T*-1 have been battered *-2 . 
Allied Stores , Western Telegraph , Gillett Holdings , 
SCI Television Texas Air , though mony other bonds 
in Columbia 's portfolio also have lost value . * 
Possibly offsetting that , Columbia estimated 0 it has 
unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than 
$ 70 million *U* . It also hopes for ultimate 
gains of as much as $ 300 million *U* on 
equity investments in buy-outs restructurings . One trial balloon 
0 Mr. Spiegel is said *-4 to have floated *T*-3 
to investors : Columbia might be broken up *-1 , 
as Mellon Bank was split *-2 into a good bank 
a bad bank . But Columbia 's good bank 
be a regulated thrift , while bad bank 
be a private investment company , holding some of 
Columbia 's junk bonds , real estate equity investments 
. Some think 0 Columbia 's thrift , which *T*-1 
is seeking a new chief operating officer , might 
be capitalized *-3 at , say $ 300 million *U* 
, shopped *-3 to a bank that *T*-2 
wants a California presence . hte thrift surely could be 
sold *-1 for more than value of its equity 
, financial industry executives say 0 *T*-2 . Meanwhile , 
bad bank with junk bonds -- some 
capital -- might be spun off *-1 to Columbia shareholders 
, including Mr. Spiegel , who *T*-2 might then have 
a new , investors say 0 *T*-3 . It 
*EXP*-1 is n't clear how much a restructuring help 
Columbia stockholders *T*-2 . But `` concept is workable 
. You sell good bank as an ongoing operation 
use some of proceeds *-1 to capitalize 
bad bank , '' says *T*-2 thrift specialist Lewis Ranieri 
of Ranieri Associates in New York . Mr. Spiegel 's 
next move is a subject of speculation on Wall 
Street . Few people think 0 Mr. Spiegel wants *-1 
to run a bread-and-butter thrift , which current rules 
force Columbia to become *T*-2 . `` n't

Wedtech scandal , begins on a reassuring note . 
Right up front in preface , co-author William Sternberg 
gives us an example of his own integrity . 
*-4 offered *-3 a free trip from Bronx , 
Wedtech 's home , to Washington , D.C. , by 
one of Wedtech 's principals *T*-2 , he tells 
reader , `` *-5 mindful of * accepting anything of 
value from those 0 I was writing about *T*-1 , 
I declined . '' Any question as to why an 
author 0 this plaintive , high-minded note of 
assurance is *T*-2 is answered *-1 by * reading 
this book about sticky fingers sweaty scammers . Bribe 
by bribe , Mr. Sternberg his co-author , Matthew 
C. Harrison Jr. , lead us along path 0 
Wedtech traveled *T*-1 , from its inception as a small 
manufacturing company to status of full-fledged defense contractor , 
entrusted * with hte task of * producing vital equipment 
for Army Navy . book revolves around 
John Mariotta , founder of company , 
Fred Neuberger , who *T*-1 became his partner soon after 
Wedtech 's creation . *-1 started in 1965 , 
Wedtech did n't get *-1 rolling until 1975 , 
Mr. Neuberger discovered federal 's Section 8 
-LRB- A -RRB- minority business program *T*-2 . This is 
a Johnson-era , Great Society creation that *T*-2 mandates 0 
contracts be awarded *-1 noncompetitively to minority businesses 
. Mr. Neuberger realized that , of Italian ancestry 
, Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person 
since he was born *-1 in Puerto Rico . 
two partners merely had *-1 to falsify true ownership 
of corporation . Instead of 50\/50 it became , 
on paper only , two-thirds Mariotta , one-third Neuberger , 
in program off to 
races . Besides *-1 being a `` minority-owned company '' 
Wedtech was located *-1 in South Bronx , a 
blighted area , made * famous by Jimmy Carter in 
his 1976 presidential campaign . company plugged itself right 
into Carter campaign rhetoric about * rebuilding South Bronx 
kept *-1 using minority -- South Bronx angle 
Reagan '80s . *-1 Starting with Congressman Mario 
Biaggi -LRB- serving a jail sentence -RRB- , 
company began a of * bribing federal , state 
local public officials those close to public officials 
, right up to *RNR*-2 including *RNR*-2 E. Robert 
Wallach , close friend adviser to former Attorney General 
Ed Meese . Wedtech did n't just use old fashioned 
bribery . It made ample use of modern 
of influence peddling , *-1 retaining politically connected `` respectable 
'' law firms , investment bankers political consultants , 
including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger . , it 
sought received assistance from crime . Sometimes 
bribed became partners in company . Wedtech used 
merit . If you helpful in 
a corrupt you received not just cash in a 
bag , but equity . If you not an 
effective crook , you found yourself out in cold 
, a fate that *T*-1 befell Mr. Mariotta , 
firm 's semiliterate `` minority '' person . But 
despite sensational of revelations breezy 
, easy-to-read tabloid writing style , `` Feeding Frenzy '' 
falls short of gripping reading . None of 
scams show much ingenuity : Auditors found crookery first 
day on job . Wedtech 's scammers simply bribed 
them to shut up . scammers themselves garden-variety 
low lifes , conspicuous consumers who *T*-1 big houses 
, Mercedes cars , beautiful women , expensive clothes . 
Among lot of them , not one is wrestling 
with good evil , or intelligent or even 
temporarily insane . one character at least somewhat 
was Irving Louis Lobsenz , a pediatrician who *T*-1 changed 
his name to Rusty Kent London became a master 
gambler author of a book on blackjack . He 
enters story toward end , just in time

Absorbed in * doling out `` Feeding Frenzy 's '' 
tidbits , authors gloss over root causes of 
Wedtech , namely Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- federal 
program under whose auspices scandal took place *T*-2 . 
do at least come around to * saying that 
courts might want *-1 to end `` rigid affirmative 
action programs . '' Programs like Section 8 -LRB- A 
-RRB- a little like * leaving gold in 
street then expressing surprise thieves walk by *-2 
to scoop it up *T*-1 . Numerous other scandals , 
among them ones at HUD , have same 
characteristics as Wedtech . take place in programs 
that *T*-1 seem tailor-made for corruption . Why programs 
like this not *-2 *T*-1 ? `` Feeding Frenzy 
'' does a few clues . In around

Soviet is causing serious bottlenecks in U.S. 
grain pipeline . Soviet purchases so massive that

to ports for * loading onto Soviet ships . River 
barge rates have soared 40 % this fall from a 
year earlier . Railroad companies some ports reaping

predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as 
exporters scrounge *-1 to find enough of thi crop 0 
*T*-2 to meet obligations to Soviets . 
Soviet bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn 
*ICH*-2 in October , which *T*-1 is most ever 
sold * to Soviet in one month from 
U.S. . Soviet wants much of it 
delivered *-2 by January , which *T*-1 be a 
strain in most . But it is 
this autumn because of low water on Mississippi 
River , on which flows *T*-1 much of U.S. 
corn that *T*-3 is shipped *-2 overseas . `` We 
shipping most corn in that short of time 
period to one customer on record , '' said *T*-1 
William Dunton , a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert . 
`` It is going *-1 to be real tight . 
'' Because of persistent dry weather in northern Plains 
, water on upper section of 
Mississippi River is so low that river operators 
already trimming number of barges 0 tows push 
*T*-1 at one time . In a few weeks , 
barges probably wo n't be able *-2 to operate 
fully loaded south of St. Louis because U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers is *-3 to reduce flow 
of Missouri River , which *T*-1 feeds into 
Mississippi River . Army Corps is cutting flow 
of Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal 
because of low water in reservoirs that *T*-1

yesterday on speculation that widespread rain *ICH*-3 this week in 
Midwest might temporarily alleviate situation . But 
Army Corps of Engineers expects river leval to continue

Similar hamstrung barge shipments last year in wake 
of worst drought in 50 . So far 
, grain industry 's budding logistical problems have n't 
been a major factor in trading of corn contracts 
at Chicago Board of Trade . grain processors 
exporters use price of corn futures contracts 
traded * *-1 to calculate price 0 
offer *T*-2 *-3 to buy corn from farmers . At 
Board of Trade yesterday price of corn 
contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel *-1 
to settle at $ 2.375 *U* a bushel . Corn 
prices have been sluggish this fall despite huge Soviet 
orders because harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild 
stockpiles depleted * by 1988 drought . With 
harvest winding down , , some analysts speculating 
that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters 
try *-1 to gather corn 0 obligated 
*-3 to deliver *T*-2 . Farmers in best 
of 0 * to push up corn 
prices *T*-1 . Because drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , 
have more than enough storage space for new 
crop , that permits them to wait for prices 
to rise . In parts of Iowa , for example 
, some grain elevators offering farmers $ 2.15 *U* 
a bushel for corn . farmers probably n't 
sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel
